‘Abdallah b.

Peace, and God’s mercy and blessings be upon you, O Prophet. Peace be upon us and upon God’s upright servants. I testify that there is no god but God, and I testify that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger.” The tashahhud in case of some need is, “Praise be to God from whom we ask help and pardon. We seek refuge in God from the evils within ourselves. He whom God guides if has no one who can lead him astray, and he whom He leads astray has no one to guide him. I testify that there is no god but God, and   that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger." And one should recite three verses: “You who believe, fear God as He should be feared, and die only as Muslims;” (Al-Qur’an 3:102). “You who believe . . . fear God by whom you ask your mutual rights, and reverence the wombs. God has been watching over you;” (Al-Qur’an 4:1 which has ‘O Mankind.’). “You who believe, if you fear God and say what is true He will make your deeds sound and forgive you your sins. He who obeys God and His Messenger has attained a mighty success” (Al-Qur’an 33:70).
Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud, Nasa’i, Ibn Majah and Darimi transmitted it. In Tirmidhi’s Jami' Sufyan ath-Thauri gave a commentary on the three verses. Ibn Majah added “whom we praise” after “praise be to God”, and “from our evil actions” after “from the evils within ourselves.” After “mighty success” Darimi added that one should then express what he needs.

Then God most high sent down regarding that, “And women already married, except those whom your right hands possess” (Al-Qur’an 4:24). That means that they were lawful for them when their ‘idda* period came to an end.

Hadith - 3046
Hajjaj b. Hajjaj al-Aslami quoted his father as saying, “Messenger of God, what will remove from me the obligation due for fostering a child.”* He replied, “A slave or a slave-girl of good quality.” 
*It is said that Arabs liked to give a woman who had fostered a child something over and above the hire. This tradition deals with the amount to be considered full compensation for services rendered.

Hadith - 3047
Abut Tufail al-Ghanawi said: When I was sitting with the Prophet a woman came forward and the Prophet spread out his cloak and she sat on it. Then when she went away someone said that this woman had suckled the Prophet. 
Abu Dawud transmitted it.
Hadith - 3048
Ibn ‘Umar told that Ghailan b. Salama ath-Thaqafi accepted Islam and that he had had ten wives in the pre-Islamic period who accepted Islam along with him; so the Prophet told him to keep four and separate from the rest of them. 
Ahmad, Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah transmitted it.
Hadith - 3049
Naufal b. Mu’awiya said: When I accepted Islam I had five wives, so I consulted the Prophet and he said, “Separate from one and keep four.” I therefore decided on the one who had been longest with me and had been barren for sixty years,* and separated from her. 
* This statement may seem strange when one considers that Naufal is said to have died in the Caliphate of Yazid b. Mu'awiya (60-64 A.H.). Some say he lived 60 years in the pre-Islamic period and 60 years in Islam. Others says he died aged 100. He is said to have accepted Islam at the Conquest of Mecca. The tradition cannot mean that he had been married to this woman for 60 years; it probably indicates that she was both barren and much older than he. She was possibly his first wife. Cf. Ibn Abu Hatim, al-Jarh wat-ta’dil, IV, i, 487 i.; Isti'ab, p. 293 ; Ibn Hajar, Tahdhib, x, 492; Isaba, iii, 1191.
It is transmitted in Sharh as-sunna.

Ibn ‘Abbas told that a woman who had accepted Islam married, and her husband (i.e. the one she had left to marry another when she became a Muslim) went to the Prophet and said, "Messenger of God, I have accepted Islam and she knew that I had done so.” So God’s Messenger took her away from her second husband and restored her to her first. In a version he said, “She accepted Islam along with me,” so he restored her to him. 
Abu Dawud transmitted it.
Hadith - 3052
In Sharh as-sunna it is related that the Prophet restored a number of women to their husbands by the first marriage when they had both accepted Islam after the change of religion and dwelling. Among them was the daughter of al-Walid b. Mughira, the wife of Safwan b. Umayya. She accepted Islam on the day of the Conquest, but her husband fled from Islam. Then his cousin Wahb b. ‘Umair was sent to him with God’s Messenger’s cloak as a guarantee of security to Safwan, and when he came God’s Messenger granted him a respite of four months before accepting Islam, so she stayed with him. Umm Hakim daughter of al-Harith b. Hisham, the wife of Ikrima b. Abu Jahl, accepted Islam in Mecca on the day of the Conquest, but her husband fled from Islam and went to the Yemen. Umm Hakim journeyed and came to him in the Yemen, and when she invited him to accept Islam he did so, and they remained married.
 
Malik transmitted it in mursal form on the authority of Ibn Shihab.
Hadith - 3053

Tirmidhi transmitted it, saying this is a tradition which is not sound, with respect to its isnad. It is transmitted only by Ibn Lahi'a and al-Muthanna b. as-Sabbah on the authority of ‘Amr b. Shu’aib, and they are both declared to be weak in tradition.
Hadith - 3055
Jabir declared that the Jews used to say: “When a man has intercourse with his wife through the vagina, but being on her back, the child will have a squint,” so the verse came down, “Your wives are a tilth to you, so come to your tilth however you will” (Al-Qur’an 2:223).

We liked withdrawing the penis and wanted to do so, but we asked ourselves whether we could do it when God’s Messenger was among us before asking him. So we asked him about that and he replied, “It does not matter if you do not do it, for every soul that is to be born up to the day of resurrection will be born.” 
(Bukhari and Muslim.)

* This is explained as referring to a woman who is suckling a child, and the fear that the child, would be injured if she became pregnant.
Muslim transmitted it.
Hadith - 3061
Judama daughter of Wahb said: I was with God’s Messenger along with some people when he was saying, “I intended to prohibit suckling during pregnancy* but I considered the Greeks and the Persians and saw that they suckled their children during pregnancy without any injury being caused to their children thereby.” Then they asked him about withdrawing the penis and God’s Messenger replied, “That is the secret burying alive” and reference is made to it in the words, “When the girl buried alive will be asked (Al-Qur’an 81:8).”

Muslim transmitted it.
Hadith - 3062
Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported God's Messenger as saying, “The most serious breach of trust in God’s sight on the day of resurrection ...” A version has, “Among those who will have the worst position in God’s sight on the day of resurrection is the man who has intercourse with his wife, and she with him, and then spreads her secret.”*

Muslim transmitted it.

(Bukhari and Muslim.)
Hadith - 3071
Ibn ‘Abbas said: Barira’s husband was a negro slave called Mughith whom I can still picture going round behind her in the streets of Medina weeping with the tears flowing on his beard. The Prophet said to al- ‘Abbas, “Are you not astonished, ‘Abbas, at Mughith’s love; of Barira and Barira’s hatred of Mughith?"

(Bukhari and Muslim.)
Hadith - 3075
Abu Salama said he asked ‘A’isha how much the Prophet had given as dower, and she replied that his dower to his wives was twelve uqiyas* and a nashsh.

She died in Medina. Razin said that someone other than ‘Ata’ declared she was Sauda, and that is sounder.

His foot being dislocated, he stayed in an upper room for twenty-nine nights and then came down; and when it was remarked to him that he has sworn to stay away for a month, he replied, “The month has twenty-nine days.”*

Bukhari transmitted it.
Hadith - 3121
Jabir said: Abu Bakr came and asked permission to go in to see the Prophet, but found the people seated at his door, none of them having been given permission. Permission was, however, given to Abu Bakr and he entered. ‘Umar then came forward, and when he had asked and had been granted permission he found the Prophet sitting sad and silent with his wives around him. He told that he decided to say something which would make the Prophet laugh, so he said, “Messenger of God, I wish you had seen the daughter of Kharija when she asked me for extra money and I got up and slapped her on the neck.” God's Messenger laughed and said, “They are around me as you see asking for extra money.” Abu Bakr then got up, went to ‘A’isha and slapped her on the neck, and ‘Umar did the same to Hafsa, both of them saying, “Are you asking God’s Messenger for what he does not possess?” They all replied, “We swear by God that we never ask God’s Messenger for anything he does not possess.” Thereafter he withdrew from them for a month or twenty-nine days. Then this verse came down, “O prophet, say to your wives ... for those who do well among you a great reward” (Al-Qur’an 33:28 f). He then went first to ‘A’isha and said, “I want to propound something to you, ‘A’isha, but wish no hasty reply before you consult your parents.” When she had asked him what it was and he had recited the verse to her she said, “Shall I consult my parents about you, Messenger of God? Nay, I choose God, His Messenger, and the final abode; but I ask you not to tell any of your wives what I have said.” He replied, “Not one of them will ask me without my informing her. God did not send me to be harsh or cause harm, but sent me to teach and make things easy.” 
Muslim transmitted it.
Hadith - 3122
‘A’isha said: Being jealous of the women who offered themselves to God's Messenger I asked, “Does a woman offer herself?” Then when God most high sent down, “You may defer any of them you wish and take to yourself any you wish, and if you desire any you have set aside no sin is chargeable to you” (Al-Qur’an 33:51) said, “It seems to me that your Lord hastens to satisfy your desire.”

Do not tell anyone of that.”  desiring to please his wives, and then there came down, “O prophet, why do you hold to be forbidden what God has made lawful for you, desiring to please your wives?

Hadith - 3171
Mu'awiya b. al-Hakam told that he went to God’s Messenger and said, “Messenger of God, I have a slave girl who was herding sheep of mine. I went to her, having missed a sheep from the flock, and asked her about it, and she told me it had been eaten by a wolf. I was annoyed with her, and being human, I struck her on the face. As it is my duty to set free a slave, should I set her free?” God’s Messenger asked her where God was and she replied that he was in heaven. He asked her who he was and she replied that he was God's Messenger. He then told him to set her free. 
Malik transmitted it.
In Muslim’s version he said, “I had a slave girl who was herding sheep of mine in the direction of Uhud and al-Jawwaniya. One day I looked and saw that a wolf had gone off with one of our sheep. Now I am a man who becomes annoyed just as others do, but I gave her a blow and then went to God’s Messenger. He treated my offence as serious, and so I asked him whether I should set her free. He told me to bring her and when I did so he asked her where God was and she replied that He was in heaven. He asked her who he was and she replied that he was God’s Messenger. He then told me to set her free, for she was a believer.”*

Then when they finished ‘Uwaimir said, “I shall have lied against her, Messenger of God, if I keep her,” and pronounced her divorce three times. God’s Messenger then said to the people, “Look, and if she bears a child which is black, and has very black eyes, large buttocks and fat legs, I cannot but imagine that ‘Uwaimir has spoken the truth about her; but if she bears a reddish child like the lizard with red spots (wahara), I cannot but imagine that ‘Uwaimir has lied against her.” She gave birth to a child like that described by God’s Messenger in declaring that ‘Uwaimir had spoken the truth, and afterwards its lineage was traced to its mother.

He reported the Prophet as saying to two who were invoking curses regarding one another, “Your reckoning is in God’s hands, for one of you is lying.” He then told the man that he could not remarry her, whereupon he said, “Messenger of God, what about my property?”* He replied, “There is no property for you. If you have spoken the truth, it is the price of your having had the right to intercourse with her; and if you have lied against her, it is more remote still from you than she is.” 
* Referring to the dower be had paid.
(Bukhari and Muslim.).
Hadith - 3175
Ibn ‘Abbas said: Hilal b. Umayya accused his wife in the Prophet’s presence of having committed adultery with Sharik b. Sahma'. When the Prophet told him that he must produce evidence or receive punishment on his back, he said, “Messenger of God, when one of us sees a man having intercourse with his wife, must he go and seek evidence?” But the Prophet merely replied that he must produce evidence or receive punishment on his back. Hilal then said, “By Him who sent you with the truth, I am speaking truly. May God send down something which will free my back from punishment!” Then Gabriel descended and brought down to him, “And those who make charges against their spouses,” reciting till he reached, “if he is one of those who speak the truth” (Al-Qur’an 24:6-9).Then Hilal came and gave testimony and the Prophet was saying, “God knows that one of you is lying. Will one of you repent?” Then the woman got up and testified, but when she was about to do it a fifth time they stopped her and told her that it would be the deciding one. Ibn ‘Abbas told that she then hesitated and drew back, so that they thought she would renounce what she had said; but thereafter she said, “I shall not disgrace my people forever,” and went on with her declaration. The Prophet told them to look and see whether she gave birth to a child with eyes looking as if they had antimony in them, wide buttocks and fat legs, for if she did, Sharik b. Sahma' would be its father. Then when she gave birth to a child of that description the Prophet said, “If it were not for what has already been stated in God’s Book, I would have dealt severely with her.” 
Bukhari transmitted it.

Abu Huraira told that Sa'd b. ‘Ubada asked, “If I were to find a man with my wife, should I not touch him before bringing four witnesses?” Then when God’s Messenger replied that that was so, he said, “By no means. I swear by Him who has sent you with the truth that I would take my sword to him before that.” God’s Messenger said, “Listen to what your chief says. He is jealous of his honour, but I am more jealous than he is and God is more jealous than I am.” 
Muslim transmitted it.
Hadith - 3177
Al-Mughira told that Sa'd b 'Ubada said, “If I saw a man with my wife I would strike him with the sword, and not with the flat of it.” When God’s Messenger heard of that he said, “Are you surprised at Sa'd’s jealousy? I swear by God that I am more jealous than he is and that God is more jealous than I am. Because of God’s jealousy He has prohibited abominations both open and secret. No one is fonder of receiving an excuse than God, on which account He has sent warners and announcers of good news; and no one is fonder of praise than God, on which account God has promised paradise.” 
(Bukhari and Muslim.)
Hadith - 3178

He asked if there was a dusky one among them, and was told that there were some. He asked how he thought that had come about, and was told that it was a strain to which they had reverted. Then saying that this was perhaps a strain to which the child had reverted, he did not permit him to disown him.

Hadith - 3180
‘A’isha said that ‘Utba b. Abu Waqqas enjoined his brother Sa'd b. Abu Waqqas that the son of Zam'a's slave girl was his, and told him to look after him. In the year of the Conquest Sa'd took him, saying he was his brother’s son, but ‘Abd b. Zam'a claimed him as his brother. They made a simultaneous plea to God’s Messenger, Sa‘d saying, “Messenger of God, my brother has enjoined me regarding him,” and ‘Abd b. Zam'a saying, "He is my brother and the son of my father's slave girl, being born on his bed.” God’s Messenger then said, "He belongs to you, ‘Abd b. Zam'a, for the child is attributed to the one on whose bed it is born, and the fornicator is deprived of any right.”1 He then told Sauda daughter of Zam'a to veil herself from him because of the resemblance to ‘Utba which he saw in him, and he did not see her till he went into God’s presence.2 In a version he said, “He is your brother, ‘Abd b. Zam'a because he was born on his father’s bed.”3

‘Amr b. Shu'aib, on his father’s authority, told of his grandfather saying: The Prophet decided regarding one who is treated as a member of a family after the death of his father to whom he is attributed when the heirs say he is one of them, that if he is the child of a slave woman whom the father owned when he had intercourse with her he is included among those who seek his inclusion, but gets none of the inheritance which was previously divided;* he however gets his portion of the inheritance which has not already been divided, but if the father to whom he is attributed had disowned him he is not joined to the heirs. If he is the child of a slave woman whom the father did not possess or of a freewoman with whom he had illicit intercourse, he is not joined to the heirs and does not inherit even if the one to whom he is attributed is the one who claims paternity, for he is a child of fornication whether his mother was free or a slave. 
Abu Dawud transmitted it.
*Mirqat 3:506 explains this as a reference to what had happened in the pre-Islamic period.

That which He loves is a man’s pride when fighting and when giving sadaqa, and that which God hates is pride shown by boasting.” A version has “by oppression.”

Then when you are in a position to be remarried, tell me." She said that when she was in a position to remarry she mentioned to him that Mu'awiya b. Abu Sufyan and Abu Jahm had asked her in marriage, and he replied, “As for Abu Jahm, he does not put down his stick from his shoulder, and as for Mu'awiya, he is a poor man who has no property; marry Usama b. Zaid." She objected to him, but he said, “Marry Usama," so she married him, God prospered him, and she was envied. A version on her authority has, “As for Abu Jahm, he is a man who is given to beating women." In a version it says that her husband divorced her three times and that when she went to the Prophet he said, “You are due no maintenance unless you are pregnant."

He asked whether he was having sexual intercourse with her, and when he was told that he was, he said, “I am inclined to invoke a curse on him which will enter his grave with him. How can he take the child into his service when that is not lawful for him, or how can he make it an heir when that is not lawful for him?”* 
* The reason for the curse is said to be because he did wait the prescribed period after acquiring the woman and so could not know whether the child was his or not.

She addressed him in foreign speech telling him that her husband wished to take her son away, and Abu Huraira told them to cast lots for him, saying that to her in foreign speech. Then her husband came and asked who was disputing with him about his son, and Abu Huraira assured him in God's name that the only reason why he said what he had said was because once when he was sitting with God’s Messenger a woman came to him and said, “Messenger of God, my husband wants to take away my son, and he had benefited me and drawn water for me from the well of Abu ‘Inaba.” (Nasa’i has “from sweet water.”) God’s Messenger replied, “Cast lots for him.” Her husband asked, “Who is disputing with me about my son?” and God’s Messenger said, “This is your father and this is your mother, so take whichever of them you wish by the hand,” and he took his mother’s hand.
