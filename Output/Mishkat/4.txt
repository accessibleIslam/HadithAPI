And do not get up to pray* till you see me do so.”

I replied, “Certainly”; so he told me to say, “God is most great ...” and similarly in the iqama. When I told God’s Messenger in the morning what I had seen he said, “It is a genuine vision, if God will; so get up along with Bilal, and when you have taught him what you have seen let him use it in making the call to prayer, for he has a stronger voice than you have. So I got up along with Bilal and began to teach it to him, and he used it in making the call to prayer. ‘Umar b, al-Khattab heard that when he was in his house, and he came out trailing his cloak and said, “Messenger of God, by Him who has sent you with the truth, I have seen the same kind of thing as has been revealed," to which God’s Messenger replied, “To God be the praise!”

Abu Huraira said that when God’s Messenger returned from the expedition to Khaibar,1 he travelled one night and stopped for rest only when he became sleepy. He told Bilal to remain on guard during the night, and he prayed as much as he could while God’s Messenger and his companions slept. When the time for dawn approached Bilal leaned on his camel facing in the direction from which the dawn should appear; but he was overcome by sleep while he was leaning on his camel, and neither God’s Messenger nor Bilal awoke, nor did any of his companions till the sun shone on them. God's Messenger was the first of them to awake, and being startled he called to Bilal, who said "He who took away my soul is the One who took away yours."2 He said, "Lead the beasts on,” and when they had done so for some distance, God’s Messenger performed ablution, gave orders to Bilal who pronounced the iqama, and then led them in the Morning Prayer. When he finished the prayer he said, "If anyone forgets prayer he should say it when he remembers it, for God has said, ‘And observe the prayer for remembrance of me.’”3

The people were startled when they awoke, and God’s Messenger ordered them to mount and get out of that wadi, saying, "This is a wadi inhabited by a devil.” So they mounted, and when they had gone out of that wadi God’s Messenger ordered them to dismount and perform ablution, and having ordered Bilal to summon the people to prayer, or pronounce the iqama, he led the people in prayer and afterwards departed. He had noticed some of their dismay, so he said, "You people must realise that God took our spirits, and if He had wished He would have returned them to us at another time than this; so if anyone of you sleeps beyond the time for prayer, or forgets it, then has recourse to it, he should observe it as he has been in the habit of doing at its proper time.” God’s Messenger then turned to Abu Bakr as-Siddiq and said, “The devil came to Bilal while he was standing engaged in prayer, and making him lie down, he kept soothing him as a child is soothed till he fell asleep.” He then summoned Bilal who told him something similar to what he had just told Abu Bakr, whereupon Abu Bakr said. “I testify that you are God’s Messenger.”

I replied, "Yes, about expiations, and they are remaining in the mosques after the prayers are over, walking on foot to the congregational prayers, and performing elaborate ablution in unpleasant circumstances (Cf. p. 151). Whoever does that will live and die righteously, and as far as his sin is concerned, he will be as he was on the day his mother gave birth to him." He said, "Muhammad, when you pray say, ‘O God, I ask Thee to enable me to do good deeds, abandon objectionable things, and love the poor, and when Thou intendest to test Thy servants, take me to Thyself without being led astray.'" He said, "People are raised in degree by saluting all and sundry, providing food, and praying at night when people are asleep." 
The wording of this tradition is as it occurs in al-Masabih, but I found it traced to ‘Abd ar-Rahman only in Sharh as-sunna.

Abu Umama reported God’s Messenger as  saying, "Three people are all in God’s safe keeping: a man who goes out to fight in God’s path, who is in God’s safe keeping till He takes his soul and brings him into paradise, or sends him home with the reward or booty he has obtained; a man who goes out to the mosque, who is in God’s safe keeping; and a man who enters his house in peace,* who is in God’s safe keeping.” 
* The translation above is given on the analogy of Al-Qur’an; 15:46. The phrase might, however, mean one who gives a salutation when he enters his house.

I got up during the night, performed ablution, and prayed what I could; but during my prayer I dozed and was overcome, and there and then I saw my Lord in the most beautiful form. He addressed me by name, and when I replied, ‘At Thy service, my Lord,’ He asked, ‘What do the angels near My presence dispute about?’ and I replied that I did not know. He asked it three times. Then I saw Him put the palm of His hand between my shoulder-blades, so that I experienced the coolness of His fingers between my nipples so everything became clear to me and I attained knowledge. He then addressed me by name, and when I replied, ‘At Thy service, my Lord,’ He asked, ‘What do the angels near My presence dispute about?’ I replied, ‘Expiation.’ He asked what they were, and I replied, ‘Walking on foot to the congregational prayers, sitting in the mosques after the prayers are over, and performing complete ablution in difficult circumstances. He asked what next they disputed about, and when I said it was about degrees, He asked what they were and I replied, ‘Providing food, speaking gently, and praying at night when people are asleep.’ He then told me to make a request, and I said, ‘O God, I ask Thee for power to do good things and abandon objectionable things, for love towards the poor, that Thou shouldest forgive me and show mercy to me, and that when Thou intendest to test any people Thou wilt take me to Thyself without being led astray. And I ask for Thy love, the love of those who love Thee, and a love of doing things which will bring me near to Thy love.’” Then God’s Messenger said, “It is true, so study it and learn it.”

At the end of every two rak'as he said the tahiya;3 and he used to bend his left foot and raise up the right; he prohibited the devil’s way of sitting on the heels, and he forbade people to spread out their arms like a wild beast.

Tahiyat is the plural of tahiya and the phrase quoted above is variously explained as meaning that endless existence, or dominion, or kingship, or freedom from all evils, or freedom from all causes of cessation of existence belong to God. Alternatively it is taken in its usual meaning of salutations.
4. Saying, “The peace and mercy of God be upon you,” first with the head turned to the right and then with the head turned to the left. This is said at the end of the prayers.

Hadith - 750
Abu Humaid as-Sa‘idi once told a company of ten of the Prophet’s companions that he was more informed than any of them regarding the manner in which God’s Messenger conducted his prayer, and when they asked him to expound it to them, he said: When God’s Messenger stood up to pray he raised his hands so as to bring them opposite his shoulders and said the takbir; then he recited some verses; then said the takbir, raising his hands so as to bring them opposite his shoulders; then he bowed, placing the palms of his hands on his knees and keeping himself straight neither raising nor lowering his head; then raised his head saying, “God listens to him who praises Him”; then raised his hands placing them exactly opposite his shoulders; then said the takbir; then lowered himself to the ground in prostration, keeping his arms away from his sides and bending his toes; then raised his head, bent his left foot and sat on it; then he adopted a natural position so that every bone returned properly to its place; then he prostrated himself; then he said the takbir, raised himself and bent his left foot and sat on it: then he adopted a natural position so that every bone returned to its place; then he got up, and did the same as that in the second rak'a. At the end of two rak'as he stood up and said the takbir, raising his hands so as to bring them opposite his shoulders in the way he had said the takbir on beginning to pray; then he did that in the remainder of his prayer, and after the sajda* which is followed by the taslim he put out his left foot and sat on his left hip; then he uttered the taslim. They said, “You have spoken the truth. This is how he used to pray.” 
 *i.e. prostration
Abu Dawud and Darimi transmitted it. And Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah transmitted something to the same effect. Tirmidhi saying that this is a hasan sahih tradition.
Then he bowed and placed his hands on his knees as though he were clutching them, and he bent his arms and kept them away from his sides. He (i.e. the narrator) said that he then prostrated himself placing his nose and his forehead on the ground, keeping his arms away from his sides, placing the palms of his hands : When he sat at the end of two rak'as he sat on the sole of his left foot and raised the right, and after the fourth he placed his left hip on the ground and put out both feet on one side.
A version by Abu Dawud of the tradition of Abu Humaid.
Hadith - 751
Wa il b. Hujr said he saw that when the Prophet stood up to pray he raised his hands till they were in front of his shoulders and placed his thumbs opposite his ears, then he said the takbir.

Hadith - 753
Rifa'a b. Rafi' said that a man came and prayed in the mosque, after which he went and saluted the Prophet, who replied, “Repeat your prayer, for you have not prayed.” He asked him to teach him how to pray and he said: When you face the qibla say the takbir; then recite Umm al-Qur’an* and what God wishes you to recite; when you bow place the palms of your hands on your knees, bowing completely and stretching out your back; when you raise yourself straighten your spine and raise your head so as to adopt an erect position; when you prostrate yourself do it completely; when you raise yourself sit on your left thigh; do that every time you bow and prostrate yourself till you are at rest, having finished your prayer. This is the wording of al-Masabih. 
*The first sura.
Abu Dawud transmitted it with a slight alteration, and Tirmidhi and Nasa’i transmitted something to the same effect. In a version by Tirmidhi he said, “When you get up to pray perform the ablution as God commanded you, then say the shahada (The testimony that there is no god but God and that Muhammad is His messenger) and proceed with the prayer. If you know any of the Qur’an recite it, otherwise say, ‘Praise be to God; God is most great; there is no god but God.’ Then bow.”
Hadith - 754
AI-Fadl b. ‘Abbas reported God’s Messenger as saying, “The prayer is in twos, every two rak'as containing an utterance of the tahiyat, and acts of submission, supplication and humility. Then you should uplift your hands, i.e., raise them to your Lord, with the palms opposite your face, and say, ‘My Lord, my Lord.’ Anyone who does not do that is such and such.”* A version has, “is guilty of imperfection.” 
*A vague phrase indicating that the prayer is defective. 
Tirmidhi transmitted it.
Hadith - 755
Sa'id b. al-Harith b. al-Mu‘alla said that Abu Sa'id al-Khudri led them in prayer and said the takbir loudly when he raised his head after the prostration, when he prostrated himself, and when he rose at the end of two rak'as, and he said, “Thus did I see the Prophet do." 
Bukhari transmitted it.
Hadith - 756

*This is the Prophet’s kunya.
Bukhari transmitted it.
Hadith - 757
‘Ali b. al-Husain told in mursal form that God’s Messenger said the takbir in prayer as often as he got down1 and got up2 and that this continued to be his method in prayer till he met God.
1. i.e. for bowing or prostration.
2. i.e. after prostration.
Malik transmitted it.
Hadith - 758
‘Alqama said that Ibn Mas'ud suggested leading them in prayer in the way God’s Messenger had performed it. He prayed, raising his hands only once, along with the takbir at the beginning. 
Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud and Nasa’i transmitted it, and Abu Dawud said it is not sahih put this way.
Hadith - 759
Abu Humaid as-Sa‘idi said that when God’s Messenger stood up to pray, he faced the qibla, raised his hands and said, “God is most great."

When he had said the taslim God’s Messenger called out to him, “So and so, do you not fear God? Do you not see how you should pray? You people think that part of what you are doing is hidden from me, but I swear by God that I see behind me just as I see in front of me." 
Ahmad transmitted it.
Hadith - 761
Abu Huraira said that God’s Messenger used to observe a period of silence between the takbir and the recitation of the Qur an, so he addressed him thus, “Messenger of God, for whom I would give my father and mother as ransom, what do you say during your period of silence between the takbir and the recitation?” He replied that he said, “O God, remove my sins far from me as Thou hast removed the East far from the West. O God, purify me from sins as a white garment is purified from filth. O God, wash away my sins with water, snow and hail.”
(Bukhari and Muslim.)
Hadith - 762
‘Ali said that when the Prophet stood up for prayer (a version saying, when he began the prayer) he said the takbir, then said, “I have turned my face as a hanif* towards Him who created the heavens and the earth, and I am not a polytheist. My prayer and my devotion, my life and my death belong to God the Lord of the universe, who has no partner. That is what I have been commanded, and I am a Muslim. O God, Thou art the King. There is no god but Thee. Thou art my Lord and I am Thy servant. I have wronged myself, but I acknowledge my sin, so forgive me all my sins, Thou who alone canst forgive sins; and guide me to the best qualities, Thou who alone canst guide to the best of them; and turn me from evil ones, Thou who alone canst turn from evil qualities. I come to serve and please Thee. All good is in Thy hands and evil does not pertain to Thee. I seek refuge in Thee and turn to Thee, who art blessed and exalted. I ask Thy forgiveness and turn to Thee in repentance.” When he bowed he said, “O God, to Thee I bow, in Thee I trust, and to Thee I submit myself. My hearing, my sight, my brain, my bone and my sinews humble themselves before Thee.” When he raised his head he said, “O God, to Thee belongs praise in the whole of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, and in whatever Thou createst afterwards.” When he prostrated himself he said, “O God, to Thee I prostrate myself, in Thee I trust, and to Thee I submit myself. My face has prostrated itself before Him who created it, fashioned it, and brought forth its hearing and seeing. Blessed is God, the best of creators.” Then at the end of what he said between uttering the tahiyat and the taslim was, “O God, forgive me my former and latter sins, my open and my secret sins, my sins of negligence, and what Thou knowest better than I. Thou art He who puts forward and puts back. There is no god but Thee.” 
* A believer in one God. Cf. Al-Qur’an; 3:95; 22:31; 98:5.
Muslim transmitted it. A version by Shafi‘i has, “Evil does not pertain to Thee, and the one who is guided is he whom Thou guidest. I seek refuge in Thee and turn to Thee. There is no shelter from Thee and no place of refuge except by having recourse to Thee who art blessed.”
Hadith - 763
Anas said that a man came panting and entered the row of worshippers and said, “God is most great. Praise be to God, much, good and blessed.” When God’s Messenger finished his prayer he asked, “Which of you is the one who spoke the words?” but the people remained silent. He asked again, and when they still kept silence, he said, “Which of you said them? He said nothing wrong.” Then a man said, “I came and had difficulty in breathing, so I said them.” He replied, “I saw twelve angels racing one another to be the one to take them up to God.” 
Muslim transmitted it.
Hadith - 764
‘A’isha said that when God’s Messenger began to pray he said, “Glory be to Thee, O God, and with praise of Thee do I begin my worship. Blessed is Thy name, exalted is Thy majesty, and there is no god but Thee.”

Hadith - 765
Jubair b. Mut'im said that he saw God’s Messenger observing a prayer in which he said, “God is altogether great; God is altogether great; God is altogether great. Praise be to God in abundance; praise be to God in abundance; praise be to God in abundance. Glory be to God in the morning and afternoon (saying it three times). I seek refuge in God from the accursed devil, from his puffing up (nafkh), his magic (nafth) 1, and his evil suggestion (hamz) 2.”
1. Literally ‘sputtering’, but used of working magic by sputtering on knots. Cf. Qur’an, 113:4.
2. For this meaning cf. Qur’an, 23:97.
Abu Dawud transmitted it, as did Ibn Majah, but he did not mention, “Praise be to God in abundance,” and he mentioned at the end of it “from the accursed devil.” ‘Umar said that his nafkh is pride, his, nafth is poetry, and his hamz is madness.
Hadith - 766
Samura b. Jundub said that he remembered from God's Messenger two periods of silence, one when he said the takbir, and one when he finished reciting, “Not of those with whom Thou art angry, nor of those who go astray,”* and Ubayy b, Ka‘b corroborated him. 
*Al-Qur’an, 1:7
Abu Dawud transmitted it, and Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Darimi transmitted something similar.
Hadith - 767
Abu Huraira said that when God's Messenger got up after the second rak'a he began the recitation with, “Praise be to God, the Lord of the universe,” without observing a period of silence. 
It is given thus in Muslim’s Sahih. Al-Humaidi mentioned it among those given by Muslim but not by Bukhari, as did the author of al-Jami' (Ibn Al-Athir) from Muslim alone.
Hadith - 768
Jabir said that when the Prophet began prayer he said the takbir, then said, “My prayer and my devotion, my life and my death belong to God, the Lord of the universe, who has no partner. I have been so commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims. O God, guide me to the best deeds and the best qualities, Thou who alone canst guide to the best of them; and guard me from evil deeds and evil qualities, Thou who alone canst guard from their evil ones.” 
Nasa’i transmitted it.
Hadith - 769
Muhammad b. Maslama said that when God’s Messenger stood up to observe voluntary prayers he said, “God is most great. I have turned my face as a hanif towards Him who created the heavens and the earth, and I am not a polytheist.” And he mentioned the tradition like that of Jabir, except that he said, “l am of the Muslims.” Then he said, “O God, Thou art the King. There is no god but Thee. Glory be to Thee, and with praise of Thee . 
Nasa’i transmitted it.
Hadith - 770
‘Ubada b. as-Samit reported God’s Messenger as saying, “He who does not recite Fatihat al-Kitab* is not credited with having observed prayer.” 
*The first sura.
(Bukhari and Muslim.) A version by Muslim has “He who does not recite Umm al-Qur’an (the first sura and something more.”
Hadith - 771
Abu Huraira reported God’s Messenger as saying, “If anyone observes a prayer in which he does not recite Umm al-Qur’an, it is deficient (he said this three times) and incomplete.” When someone asked Abu Huraira  if he were led by an imam, he told him to recite it inwardly, for he had heard God’s Messenger declare that God most high had said, “I have divided the prayer into two halves between me and my servant, and my servant will receive what he asks.” When the servant says, “Praise be to God the Lord of the universe,” God most high says, “My servant has praised me.” When he says, “The Compassionate the Merciful,” God most high says, “My servant has lauded me.” When he says, “Possessor of the day of judgment,” He says, “My servant has glorified me.” When he says, “Thee do we worship and of Thee do we ask help,” He says, “This is between me and my servant, and my servant will receive what he asks.” Then when he says, “Guide us in the straight path, the path of those to whom Thou art generous, not of those with whom Thou art angry nor of those who go astray,” He says. “This is for my servant, and my servant will receive what he asks.” 
Muslim transmitted it.

(Bukhari and Muslim.) In a version he said, “When the imam says, ‘Not of those with whom Thou art angry nor of those who go astray’, say Amen, for if anyone’s words synchronise with those of the angels he will be forgiven his past sins.” This is Bukhari’s wording, and Muslim has something similar. In another version by Bukhari he said, “Say Amen when the reciter (i.e. the imam) says it, for the angels do so, and if anyone’s utterance of Amen synchronises with that of the angels, he will be forgiven his past sins.”
Hadith - 774
Abu Musa al-Ash‘ari reported God’s Messenger as saying: When you pray make your rows straight and let one of your number act as your imam. If you say the takbir when he says it and say Amen when he says “Not of those with whom Thou art angry nor of those who go astray”, God will accept your prayer. When he says the takbir and bows, say it and bow, for the imam bows before you and raises himself before you. Then God’s Messenger said, “The one is equivalent to the other.”* And he said: If you say, “O God our Lord, to Thee be the praise,” when he says, “God listens to him who praises him,” God will listen to you. 
* Although the imam begins and ends his bowing before you do, your bow lasts the same length of time as his.
Muslim transmitted it. In a version by him from Abu Huraira and Qatada the words occur, “And when he recites listen silently.”
Hadith - 775
Abu Qatada said that in the first two rak'as of the noon prayer the Prophet used to recite Umm al-Kitab and two suras, and in the last two rak'as Umm al-Kitab, and he would sometimes recite loud enough for them to hear the verse. He would prolong the first rak'a more than the second; and he acted similarly in the afternoon and the Morning Prayer. 
(Bukhari and Muslim.)
Hadith - 776
Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said, “We used to estimate how long God’s Messenger stood at the noon and the afternoon prayer, and we estimated that he stood in the first two rak'as as long as it takes to recite A.L.M. Tanzil, i.e. as-Sajda* (A version has, “In every rak'a as long as it takes to recite thirty verses.” We estimated that he stood half that time in the last two rak'as; that he stood in the first two of the afternoon prayer as long as he did in the last two at noon; and in the last two of the afternoon prayer about half that time.”

A man turned aside, pronounced the taslim, then prayed alone and departed. The people said to him, “Have you become a hypocrite, so and so?” He replied, I swear by God that I have not, but I shall certainly go to God’s Messenger and tell him.” So he went to him and said, “Messenger of God, we look after camels used for watering and work by day. After having prayed the evening prayer with you, Mu'adh came and began with Sura al-Baqara.” God’s Messenger then approached Mu'adh and said, “Are you a troubler, Mu’adh? Recite, ‘By the sun and its morning brightness,’2 ‘By the morning brightness,’3 ‘By the night when it covers over,’4 and ‘Glorify the name of thy most high Lord’.”5

When one of you sits during the prayer he should say, “The adorations of the tongue, acts of worship and all good things are due to God. Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and God’s mercy and blessings. Peace be upon us and upon God’s upright servants (for when he says that it reaches every upright servant in heaven and earth).

I testify that there is no god but God, and I testify that Muhammad is God’s Messenger.’’ 
Muslim transmitted it. In the two Sahihs and in al-Jam' bain as-Sahihain I did not find “Peace be upon you” and “Peace be upon us” without the definite article, but the author of al-Jami' transmitted it that way from Tirmidhi.
Hadith - 855
Wa’il b. Hujr said concerning God’s Messenger, “Then he sat, stretched out his left foot , placed his left hand on his left thigh, put the tip of his right elbow on his right thigh, joined two fingers, 1 formed a ring, 2 then raised his finger, 3 and I saw him moving it and making supplication at the same time.”

‘Abd ar-Rahrman b. Abu Laila said that Ka‘b b. ‘Ujra met him and asked if he would like him to present him with something he had heard from the Prophet. He expressed his desire to hear it, and he said: We asked God’s Messenger this question, “How is blessing to be invoked on you who belong to the prophetic family? God has taught us  how to salute you.” He told us to say, “O God, bless Muhammad and Muhammad’s family as Thou didst bless Abraham and Abraham’s family. Thou art indeed praiseworthy and glorious.

When you pray and come to the point when you sit, you should worthily extol God’s praises, invoke blessing on me, and then make your supplication.” He said that afterwards another man prayed, extolling God’s praises and invoking a blessing on the Prophet, and the Prophet said to him, “You who are praying, if you make supplication you will receive an answer.”

Hadith - 885

Muslim transmitted it.

Thou art the forgiving and the merciful One.”

(Bukhari and Muslim.)

Hadith - 909
Abu Huraira told of the poor Emigrants coming to God’s Messenger and saying, “The possessors of great wealth have obtained all the highest grades and lasting bliss.” When he asked what they meant they replied, “They pray as we do, they fast as we do, they give alms but we do not, and they set slaves free but we do not.” So God’s Messenger said, “Shall I not teach you something by which you will catch up on those who have preceded you and get ahead of those who come after you, only those who do as you do being more excellent than you?” On their replying, “Certainly, Messenger of God,” he said, “Extol God, declare His greatness, and praise Him thirty-three times after every prayer.” Abu Salih said that the poor Emigrants returned to God’s Messenger saying, “Our brethren, the possessors of property, have heard what we have done, and they have done the same,” to which he replied, “That is God’s grace, which He gives to whom He wishes.” (Al-Qur’an; 5:54; 57:21; 62:4.) 
(Bukhari and Muslim) What Abu Salih said is given up to the end only by Muslim. A version has, “Extol God ten times after every prayer, praise Him ten times, and declare His greatness ten times,” instead of thirty-three times given by Bukhari.
Hadith - 910
Ka'b b. ‘Ujra reported God’s Messenger as saying, “There are certain ejaculations the repeaters (or, performers)* of which after every prescribed prayer will never be caused disappointment: ‘Glory be to God’ thirty-three times, ‘Praise be to God’ thirty-three times, and ‘God is most great’ thirty-four times.”

‘Uqba b. ‘Amir said that God’s Messenger ordered him to recite al-Mu'awwidhat* after every prayer. 
* Suras 113 and 114 are commonly called al-Mu'awwidhatan, this being the dual. Although al-Masabih has the dual, the Mishkat has the plural. In the notes to the Damascus edition it is suggested that suras 109 and 112 may be added, but it is more probable that the Mishkat has used the plural in error.
Ahmad, Abu Dawud, Nasa’i and Baihaqi, in  ad-da‘awat al-kabir, transmitted it.
Hadith - 914
Anas reported God’s Messenger as saying, “To sit with people who make mention of God after the morning prayer till sunrise is more pleasing to me than setting free four of the descendants of Ishmael, and to sit with people who make mention of God after the afternoon prayer till the sun sets is more pleasing to me than setting four free.” 
Abu Dawud transmitted it.

Hadith - 916
Al-Azraq b. Qais said that an imam, of theirs whose kunya was Abu Rimtha led them in prayer and said: I prayed this prayer, or one like it, along with God’s Messenger. Abu Bakr and ‘Umar were standing in the front row on his right, and there was a man who had been present at the first takbira in the prayer. God’s Prophet prayed the prayer, then gave the salutation to his right and his left so that we saw the whiteness of his cheeks, then turned away as Abu Rimtha (meaning himself) has done. The man who had been present with him at the first takbira in the prayer then got up to pray another prayer, whereupon ‘Umar leaped up, and seizing him by the shoulders, shook him and said, “Sit down, for the People of the Book will perish for no other reason than that there was no interval between their prayers.” The Prophet raised his eyes and said, “God has made you say what is right, son of al-Khattab.” 
Abu Dawud transmitted it.
Hadith - 917
Zaid b. Thabit said: We were commanded to say after every prayer, 'Glory be to God’ thirty-three times, ‘Praise be to God’ thirty-three times, and ‘God is most great’ thirty-four times. One of the Ansar had a vision in sleep in which he was asked, “Has God’s Messenger commanded you to say ‘Glory be to God’ such and such a number of times after every prayer?” When the Ansari replied in his sleep that that was so, the visitant said, “Do it twenty-five times, and join to it ‘There is no god but God’ twenty-five times.” In the morning, when he went and told the Prophet, he said, “Do so."
Ahmad, Nasa’i and DarimI transmitted it.
Hadith - 918
‘Ali said: I heard God’s Messenger say on the timbers of this pulpit, “If anyone recites the Throne verse (Al-Qur’an; 2:255) at the end of every prayer, nothing but death will prevent him from entering paradise; and if he recites it when he goes to bed, God will grant security to his house, his neighbour’s house, and the inhabitants of the little dwellings around him.”
Baihaqi transmitted it in Shu'ab al-iman, but said that its isnad is weak.
Hadith - 919
‘Abd ar-Rahman b. Ghanm reported the Prophet as saying, “If anyone says ten times before he departs and turns away his feet after the senset and the morning prayers, ‘There is no god but God alone who has no partner, to whom belongs the kingdom, to whom praise is due, in whose hand is good, who gives life, causes death, and is omnipotent,’ ten blessings will be recorded for him for every time he says it, ten evil deeds will be obliterated, he will be raised ten degrees, it will act as a charm for him from every unpleasantness and from the accursed devil, he will not be taken to account for any sin but polytheism, and he will be among those whose deeds are most excellent, except for one who may excel him by saying something more excellent than he did.” 
Ahmad transmitted it, and Tirmidhi transmitted something to the same effect from Abu Dharr up to “but polytheism”. He did not mention the sunset prayer, or “In whose hand is good", and he said this is a hasan sahih gharib tradition.
Hadith - 920
‘Umar b. al-Khattab said that the Prophet sent to Najd an expedition which took much booty and came back quickly. A man who had not gone out said, “We have never seen an expedition return more quickly or bring finer booty than this one," whereupon the Prophet said, “Shall I not indicate to you people who have most excellent booty and a most excellent return? They are people who have been present at the Morning Prayer, then sat making mention of God till the sun rose. Those have the quickest return and most excellent booty." 
Tirmidhi transmitted it and said this is a gharib tradition and Hammad b. Abu Humaid the transmitter is weak in tradition.
Hadith - 921
Mu'awiya b. al-Hakam said: While I was praying along with God's Messenger a man in the campany sneezed, and I said, “God have mercy on you!” The people gave me disapproving looks, so I said, “Woe is me! What do you mean by looking at me?” They began to strike their hands on their thighs, and when I saw them urging me to be silent ”. I said, “Among us there are men who draw lines.”3 He replied, “There was a prophet who drew lines, so if any do it as he did, that is allowable.” 
1. Some such phrase as that in brackets is required to complete the sense. It can be seen from the remarks at the end of the tradition that the text has been considered difficult.
2. Diviners, soothsayers.
3. The reference is to geomancy. The diviner draws many lines and obliterates them in pairs. If two are left it is a good sign, but if only one remains it indicates disappointment. The reference to the prophet may be a recollection of the statement in John 8:6 that Jesus wrote on the ground with his finger when the people asked what should be done with the woman caught in adultery; but this has no connection with geomancy.
Muslim transmitted it. I found the phrase “But I said nothing” given thus in Muslim’s Sahih and al-Humaidi’s book. In Jami' al-usul it is stated to be correct, the word “thus”* being written above “but I.”
*This corresponds to the use of (sic) to indicate an accurate quotation.
Hadith - 922
‘Abdallah b. Mas'ud said: We used to greet the Prophet while he was engaged in prayer and he would respond to our greeting, but when we returned from the Negus* we greeted him and he did not respond to us, so we said, “Messenger of God, we used to greet you when you were engaged in prayer and you would respond to us.” He replied, “Prayer demands one’s whole attention.” 
* The reference is to the return of those who had gone from Mecca to Abyssinia when Muslims were being persecuted.

Abu Sa'id reported God’s Messenger as saying, “When one of you yawns during prayer he must restrain it as much as possible, for the devil gets in.” 
Muslim transmitted it. In a version by Bukhari from Abu Huraira he said, “When one of you yawns during prayer he must restrain it as much as possible and not say ‘Ha’, for that comes from the devil who is laughing at him.”(Or “at it”, i.e. at this action).
Hadith - 929
Abu Huraira reported God’s Messenger as saying, “An ‘ifrit of the jinn escaped yesterday to interrupt my prayer, but God gave me power over him, so I seized him and intended to tie him to one of the pillars of the mosque in order that you might all look at him; but I remembered the supplication of my brother Solomon, ‘My Lord, give me such a kingdom as will not be fitting for anyone after me’ (Al-Qur’an; 38:35) so I made him clear out.” 
(Bukhari and Muslim.)
Hadith - 930
Sahl b. Sa‘d reported God's Messenger as saying, “If anything happens to someone during prayer he should say, ‘Glory be to God,’ for clapping applies only to women.” In a version he said, “Saying 'Glory be to God’ applies to men and clapping to women.” 
(Bukhari and Muslim.)
Hadith - 931
'Abdallah b. Mas'ud said: Before we went to Abyssinia we used to greet God’s Messenger when he was engaged in prayer and he would respond to us, but when we returned from Abyssinia I came to him and found him praying. I greeted him and he did not respond to me, but when he finished his prayer he said, “God creates new commands as He wishes, and one of them is that you must not talk during prayer.” He then returned my greeting and said, “Prayer is solely for the purpose of reciting the Qur’an and making mention of God, so when you are engaged in it let that be what occupies your attention.” 
Abu Dawud transmitted it.
Hadith - 932
Ibu ‘Umar said he asked Bilal how the Prophet responded to them when they greeted him while he was engaged in prayer, and he replied, “He used to make a sign with his hand.”

Rifa'a b. Rafi‘ said : I prayed behind God's Messenger, and on sneezing I said, “Praise be to God, great, good, blessed and abounding in good, as our Lord wishes and is pleased with.” When God's Messenger finished his prayer he moved away and asked, “Who was it who spoke during the prayer?” but no one replied. He asked a second time, but no one replied. He asked a third time, and Rifa'a said, “I did, Messenger of God.” Thereupon the Prophet said, “By Him in whose hand my soul is, over thirty angels raced to it to see which of them would ascend with it.” 
Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud and Nasa’i transmitted it.

When he finished the prayer we said, “Messenger of God, we heard you say something during the prayer which we have not heard you say before, and we saw you stretch out your hand.” He replied, “God’s enemy Iblis came with a flame of fire to put it in my face, so I said three times, ‘I seek refuge in God from you’. Then I said three times, ‘I curse you with God’s perfect curse', but he did not retreat. Thereafter I meant to seize him. I swear by God that had it not been for the supplication of my brother Solomon, he would have been bound and made an object of sport for the Medina children.”*

Yasar said that Abu Sa'id reported God’s Messenger as saying, “When one of you is in doubt aoout his prayer and does not know how much he has prayed, three or four rak'as, he should subtract what he is doubtful about and base his prayer on what he is sure of, then perform two prostrations before giving the salutation. If he has prayed five rak'as they will make his prayer an even number for him, and if he has prayed exactly four they will be a humbling for the devil.”

(Bukhari and Muslim.)
Hadith - 957
Ibn Sirin reported Abu Huraira as saying: God’s Messenger led us in one of the two evening ('ashiy)1 prayers. (Ibn Sirin said that Abu Huraira named it, but he had forgotten which, it was.) He led us in two rak'as and when he had given the salutation he got up, and going towards a piece of wood which was placed crosswise in the mosque, he leaned on it looking as if he were angry. He placed his right hand on his left, and intertwining his fingers, he placed his right cheek on the back of his left hand. Those who were first to come out of the doors of the mosque said, “The prayer has been shortened." Abu Bakr and ‘Umar were among the people, but they were too afraid to speak to him; but among them was a man with such long arms that he was called “The possessor of arms" (Dhulyadain) who asked, “Have you forgotten, Messenger of God, or has the prayer been shortened?” He replied, “I have neither forgotten, nor has it been shortened." He then asked whether things were as the possessor of arms had said, and when he was told that that was so he went forward and prayed what he had omitted. He then gave the salutation, then said “God is most great" and made his usual prostration or one a little longer, then raised his head and said “God is most great", then said “God is most great" and made his usual prostration or one a little longer, then raised his head and said “God is most great". He2 was often asked whether he then gave the salutation and he would say: I have been informed that ‘Imran b. Husain said he then gave the salutation. 
    1. ‘Ashiy generally means evening, but it also means the time between the declining of the sun after the meridian and sunset or morning, so the two prayers here mentioned are the noon (zuhr) prayer and the afternoon prayer.

(Bukhari and Muslim, the wording being Bukhari’s.) In another version given by both of them, instead of saying “I have neither forgotten nor has it been shortened” God’s Messenger said, “None of that has happened," to which he replied, “Some of it has, Messenger of God."

(Bukhari and Muslim.)

‘Amr b. ‘Abasa said: After the Prophet had gone to Medina I went there, and I visited him and said, “Tell me about the prayer.” He replied, “Observe the Morning Prayer, then stop praying when the sun is rising till it is fully up, for when it rises it comes up between the horns of the devil, and the infidels prostrate themselves to it at that time. Then pray, for the prayer is witnessed and angels are attendant at it, till the shadow becomes about the breadth of a lance; then cease prayer, for at that time jahannam is heated up. Then when the shadow moves forward pray, for the prayer is witnessed and angels are attendant at it, till you pray the afternoon prayer; then cease prayer till the sun sets, for it sets between the horns of the devil, and at that time the infidels prostrate themselves to it.” I then asked God’s prophet to tell me about ablution, and he said, “None of you will keep his water for ablution handy and
 rinse his mouth, snuff up water and blow it out without the sins of his face, his mouth and the inner parts of his nose falling out. When he then washes his face as God has commanded him the sins of his face will fall out at the ends of his beard along with the water; when he then washes his arms up to the elbows the sins of his arms will fall out at his finger-tips along with the water; when he then wipes his head the sins of his head will fall out at the ends of his hairs along with the water when he then washes his feet up to the ankles the sins of his feet will fall out at his toes along with the water. Then if he stands praying, and praises, lauds and glorifies God as is fitting and devotes his whole heart to God, his sin will depart leaving him as he was the day his mother bore him.” 
Muslim transmitted it.

Kuraib said that Ibn ‘Abbas, al-Miswar b. Makhrama and ‘Abd ar-Rahman b. al-Azhar sent him to ‘A’isha telling him to give her their greetings and ask her about the two rak'as after the afternoon prayer. He said that when he went to visit her and conveyed their message she told him to ask Umm Salama, so he came out to them and they sent him back to Umm Salama who said : I heard the Prophet prohibiting them and afterwards saw him praying them. When he came in I sent the slavegirl to him telling her to say that Umm Salama sent this query, “Messenger of God, I heard you prohibiting these two, and I see you praying them.” He replied, “Daughter of Abu Umayya,* you have asked about the two rak'as after the afternoon prayer. Some people of ‘Abd Qais came and hindered me from praying the two rak'as which come after the noon prayer, so those are the two I have been praying.”
* Abu Umayya was Umm Salama’s father. Although the slavegirl conveyed the query, the reply is given as if addressed directly to Umm Salama.
(Bukhari and Muslim)
Hadith - 983
Muhammad b. Ibrahim on the authority of Qais b. ‘Amr told how when the prophet saw a man praying two rak'as after the Morning Prayer he said, “At the Morning Prayer pray two rak'as."

Abu Dawud transmitted it. Tirmidhi transmitted something similar, saying, “The isnad of this tradition is not connected, because Muhammad b. Ibrahim did not hear from Qais b. ‘Amr.” There is something similar in Sharh as-sunna and in some texts of al-Masabih from Qais b. Qahd.

If you knew the blessings they contain you would come to them, even though you had to crawl on your knees. The first row is like that of the angels, and if you knew the nature of its excellence you would race to join it. A man’s prayer said along with another is purer than his prayer said alone, and his prayer with two men is purer than his prayer with one, but if there are more it is more pleasing to God.”

He also said: God’s Messenger taught us the paths of right guidance, among which is prayer in the mosque in which the adhan is called. In a version he said: If anyone would like to meet God tomorrow as a Muslim he should persevere in observing these five times of prayer where the announcement for them is made, for God has laid down for your Prophet the paths of right guidance, among which are the prayers. If you were to pray in your houses as this man who stays away prays in his house, you would abandon the practice of your Prophet, and if you were to abandon the practice of your Prophet you would go astray. No man purifies himself, doing it well, then makes for one of these mosques, without God recording a blessing for him for every step he takes, raising him a degree for it and removing a sin from him for it. I have seen the time when no one stayed away from it except a hypocrite who was well known as such, whereas a man would be brought swaying* between two men till he was set up in the row.”

Hudhaifa came forward and took him by the hands, and ‘Ammar followed him till he brought him down. When ‘Ammar finished his prayer Hudhaifa said to him: Did you not hear God’s Messenger say, “When a man leads the people in prayer he must not stand in a position higher than theirs,” or words to that effect? ‘Ammar replied, “That is why I followed you when you took me by the hand.” 
Abu Dawud transmitted it.

Sahl b. Sa‘d as-Sa‘idi said he was asked what the pulpit was made of and replied, “It was from the tamarisks of al-Ghaba, made by so and so, client of such and such a woman, for God’s Messenger. When it was made and placed in position God’s Messenger mounted it, faced the qibla, and said ‘God is most great’, the people standing behind him. He recited some verses and bowed, and the people bowed behind him. He then raised his head, moved backwards and prostrated himself to the ground, then returned to the pulpit, then recited some verses, then bowed, then raised his head, then moved backwards and prostrated himself to the ground.” 
This is Bukhari’s wording. In a version given both by him and by Muslim there is something similar, at the end of which it is said: Then when he finished he faced the people and said, “O people, I have done this only that you should be guided by me and know how I conduct prayer.”

Hadith - 1054
Qais b. ‘Ubad said: While I was in the mosque in the front row a man pulled me from behind, moved me aside and took my place, with the result, I swear by God, that I did not know what prayers I said. When he had finished I saw that he was Ubayy b. Ka'b. He said, “Young man, God does not wrong you, for this is a charge from the Prophet to us that we should be near him.” He then faced the qibla and said three times, “May ahl al-'aqd perish, by the Lord of the Ka'ba!” Then he said, “I swear by God that I do not grieve for them, but for those they have led astray.” I asked, “Abu Ya'qub, what do you mean by ahl al-'aqd?”* He replied, “The commanders.” 
* One of the meanings of 'aqd is “responsibility.’’ The phrase literally means “the people bf responsibility”, i.e. those who are in responsible positions. A chief ruler may be called sahib al-'aqd wal hall, i.e. he who binds and looses.

I heard God’s Messenger say, "If anyone visits people he must not act as their imam, but one of their men must do so.”

Hadith - 1061

Hadith - 1064
‘Amr b. Salima said: We lived by water which people passed. Riders would pass by us and we would ask them, "What has happened to the people? What has happened to the people? What is this man like?” and they would reply, "He asserts that God has sent him, has made a revelation to him, has made a revelation to him to this effect.”I was remembering those words with the result that they seemed to be glued in my breast. By their acceptance of Islam the Arabs were expecting victory for they would say ‘Let him and his people alone, for if be gets the better of them, he is a true prophet.’ Then when the battle of the conquest of Mecca took place every tribe hastened to accept Islam, and my father was the first of my tribe to accept it. When he returned he said: I swear by God that I have come to you from him who is truly the Prophet. He said, “Pray such and such a prayer at such and such a time, and such and such a prayer at such and such a time. When the time of prayer comes one of you should call the >i>adhan and the one of you who knows most of the Qur’an should act as your imam” So they considered, and there was no one who knew more of the Our’an than I did because of what I had received from the riders. They therefore put me forward in front of them, and I was only six or seven years old. I wore a mantle which, when I prostrated myself, went up on me, and a woman of the clan said, “Why do you not cover the backside of your reader from us?” So they bought and cut out a shirt for me, and I have never been so pleased about anything as I was about that shirt. 
Bukhari transmitted it.

* The word here is most probably used in the widest sense, meaning two Muslims.
Ibn Majah transmitted it.

Hadith - 1070
Qais b. Abu Hazim said Abu Mas'ud told him of a man saying, “I swear by God, Messenger of God, that I keep away from the Morning Prayer on account of so and so, because he keeps us so long.” I never saw God’s Messenger more angry when giving an exhortation than he was that day. He said, “Some of you are scaring people away, so whoever of you leads the people in prayer must be brief, for among them are the weak, the aged, and people who have business to do.” 
(Bukhari and Muslim.)
Hadith - 1071

Hadith - 1072
‘Uthman b. Abul ‘As said that the last command God’s messenger gave him was, “When you act as imam for people, make the prayer short." Muslim transmitted it. 
In a version by him it says that God's messenger said to him, “Act as imam for your people” to which he said he replied, “Messenger of God, I find a defect in myself.” Telling him to come near and making him sit down in front of him, he placed his hand on his breast between his nipples; then telling him to turn round, he placed it on his back between his shoulders. He then said, “Act as imam for your people. Whoever acts as imam for people must be brief, for among them are the aged, among them are the sick, among them are the weak, and among them are people who have busi­ness to do. But when any of you prays alone he may pray as he likes.”

Anas said: God’s Messenger led us in prayer one day, and when he finished his prayer he faced us and said, "O people, I am your imam, so do not bow, prostrate yourselves, stand, or go away before I do, for I see you both in front of me and behind me." 
Muslim transmitted it.
Hadith - 1076
Abu Huraira reported God’s Messenger as saying, "Do not try to go ahead of the imam. When he says ‘God is most great’ say ‘God is most great’; when he says ‘Nor of those who err’ (i.e. the end of sura 1) say ‘Amen’; when he bows bow; and when he says ‘God listens to him who praises Him’ say, ‘O God, our Lord, to Thee be the praise’." 
(Bukhari and Muslim, but Bukhari did not mention "and when he says, ‘Nor of those who err”’.)
Hadith - 1077
Anas said God’s Messenger was thrown off a horse he was riding and his right side was grazed. He then prayed one of the prayers sitting and we prayed behind him sitting, and when he finished he said, "The imam is appointed only to be followed; so when he prays standing pray standing, when he bows bow, when he raises himself raise yourselves, when he says ‘God listens to him who praises Him say, ‘Our Lord, to Thee be the praise’, and when he prays sitting all of you pray sitting." 
Al-Humaidi said that "when he prays sitting pray sitting" was said during his earlier illness.* After that the Prophet prayed sitting while the people behind him were standing, but he did not order them to sit, and it is only the last action of the Prophet that is to be acted upon. 
* The reference is to his illness at the time when he swore not to go near his wives for a month.
This is Bukhari’s wording, and Muslim has the same up to “all of you”. In a version he added, “Do not act differently from him, and prostrate yourselves when he prostrates himself.”
Hadith - 1078
‘A’isha said: When God’s Messenger was seriously ill* and Bilal came to announce the time of prayer for him, he said, “Order Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer.” So Abu Bakr led the prayer during those days, then when the Prophet experienced some improvement in his condition he got up and came into the mosque swaying between two men with his feet touching the ground. On hearing the sound Abu Bakr began to withdraw, but God’s Messenger signed to him not to do so. He then came and sat at Abu Bakr’s left, and Abu Bakr prayed standing and God’s Messenger prayed sitting, Abu Bakr following God’s Messenger’s prayer, while the people followed Abu Bakr’s. 
* Here the reference is to the Prophet's last illness.
(Bukhari and Muslim.) They both have a version which says that Abu Bakr caused the people to hear the takbir.

Hadith - 1084
Abu Sa'id al-Khudri told how a man came when God’s Messenger had already prayed, and he said, “Will no one give alms* to this man and pray along with him?” Thereupon a man got up and prayed along with him. 
* This is a literal translation. The idea is that by joining with him he increased the reward the man would receive for his prayer, as prayer in company has a much greater reward than prayer alone.
Tirmidhi and Abu Dawud transmitted it.
Hadith - 1085
‘Ubaidallah b. ‘Abdallah said he visited ‘A’isha and asked her to tell him about the illness of God’s Messenger. She agreed and said: The Prophet was seriously ill, and he asked whether the people had prayed. When I told him that they had not, but were waiting for him, he asked me to put some water for him in the tub, and I did so. He bathed, and when he was about to rise with difficulty he fainted. When he came round he asked if the people had prayed, and when I told him that they had not, but were waiting for him, he told me to put some water for him in the tub and sat down and bathed, but when he was about to rise with difficulty he fainted. On coming round he asked whether the people had prayed, and when I told him they had not, but were waiting for him, he asked me to put some water for him in the tub and sat down and bathed, but when he was about to rise with difficulty he fainted. When he came round he asked whether the people had prayed and I told him they had not, but were waiting for him. The people were staying in the mosque waiting for the Prophet for the last evening prayer, so the Prophet sent instructions to Abu Bakr to lead the people in the prayer. When the Messenger came to him and told him God’s Messenger was ordering him to lead the people in the prayer, Abu Bakr, who was a sensitive man, told ‘Umar to lead the people, but when ‘Umar replied, “You are more entitled to that,” Abu Bakr led the prayers during those days. Afterwards the Prophet experienced some improvement in his condition and went out between two men, one of whom was al-‘Abbas, to the noon prayer when Abu Bakr was leading the people. When Abu Bakr saw him he began to withdraw, but the Prophet signed to him not to do so. He told his two companions to set him down beside Abu Bakr, and they did so and he remained seated. ‘Ubaidallah said that he visited ‘Abdallah b. ‘Abbas and asked if he might submit to him what ‘A’isha had told him about the illness of God’s Messenger, and he said, “Go ahead.” He submitted to him what she had told and he objected to none of it, only asking whether she had named to him the man who accompanied al- ‘Abbas. When he replied that she had not, he said that he was ‘Ali. 
(Bukhari and Muslim.)
Hadith - 1086

In al-Masabih, where the division of the chapters is into traditions which are sahih and traditions which are hasan, the collection of Tradition from which they are taken is not mentioned, but all those in section I are meant to be taken from Bukhari, or Muslim, or both. I have failed to find this one anywhere. The concordance does not seem to refer to it.
Hadith - 1090
Yazid b. al-Aswad said: I was present with the Prophet at his pilgrimage and prayed the Morning Prayer along with him in the mosque of al-Khaif. When he finished his prayer and turned away there were two men at the back of the people who had not prayed along with him. He said, “Bring them to me,” and they were brought trembling with fear. He asked what had prevented them from praying along with him, and they replied, “Messenger of God, we had already prayed in our lodging.” He said, “Don’t do so. When you pray in your lodging and then come to a mosque where there is a congregation, you must pray along with them, and it will be a supererogatory prayer for you. 
Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud and Nasa’i transmitted it.
Hadith - 1091
Busr b. Mihjan reported his father as saying he had been at a meeting along with God’s Messenger when the adhan for prayer was called. God’s Messenger got up and prayed, and when he returned he found Mihjan sitting where he had been, so he asked him, “What prevented you from praying along with the people? Are you not a Muslim?” He replied, “Certainly, Messenger of God; but I had already prayed at home.” God’s Messenger then said to him, “When you come to the mosque having mready prayed and the time for prayer comes, pray along with the people even if you have already prayed.” 
Malik and Nasa’i transmitted it.
Hadith - 1092
A man of Asad b. Khuzaima said he put this question to Abu Ayyub al-Ansari: I* pray at home and then go to the mosque and the time to begin the prayer comes, so I pray along with the congregation, but I feel some uneasiness about that. Abu Ayyub replied, “We asked the Prophet about that and he said that such a person gets a portion of the reward for corporate prayer.” 
* The Arabic has “One of us prays . . . then goes . . .” After that the first person singular is used. While such a construction is quite usual in 'Arabic, it makes impossible English, so I have used the first person all through.
Malik and Abu Dawud transmitted it.
Hadith - 1093
Yazid b. ‘Amir said: I came to God’s Messenger when he was praying and sat down, but did not join the congregation in prayer. When he finished he saw me sitting and asked, “Have you not become a Muslim, Yazid?” I replied, “I certainly have become a Muslim, Messenger of God.” He asked, “What prevented you from joining the people in their prayer?” I replied, “I had already prayed at home, thinking you had prayed.” So he said, “When you come to prayer and find the people praying, pray along with them. If you have already prayed it will be a supererogatory prayer for you, though this is a prescribed prayer.” 
Abu Dawud transmitted it.
Hadith - 1094
Ibn ‘Umar said that a man questioned him saying, “When I pray in my house and then come to the mosque in time for prayer along with the imam, should I pray along with him?” He replied, “Yes.” The man asked which of them he should consider his obligatory prayer, and Ibn ‘Umar replied, “Is that your affair?* that is only to be left to God’s decision who will appoint whichever He wishes.” 
*The Arabic is in the form of a statement, but in view of the phrase immediately following it seems necessary to treat it as a question.
Malik transmitted it.
Hadith - 1095
Sulaiman, client of Maimuna said: We came to Ibn ‘Umar at al- Balat* when the people were praying, and I remarked on the fact that he was not praying along with the people.

Umm Habiba reported God’s Messenger as saying, “A house will be built in paradise for anyone who prays in a day and a night twelve rak'as, four before and two after the noon prayer, two after the sunset prayer, two after the evening prayer, and two before the dawn prayer.” 
Tirmidhi transmitted it. In a version by Muslim she said she heard God’s Messenger say, “If any Muslim prays to God twelve voluntary rak'as daily, over and above the obligatory ones, God will build a house for him in paradise,” or, “a house will be built for him in paradise.”
Hadith - 1098

He would lead the people in the sunset prayer, then come in and pray two rak'as. Then he would lead the people in the evening prayer, and enter my house and pray two rak'as. He would pray nine rak'as during the night, including the witr.* At night he would pray for a long time standing and for a long time sitting, and when he recited the Qur’an while standing he would bow and prostrate himself from the standing position, and when he recited while sitting he would bow and prostrate himself from the sitting position; and when dawn came he prayed two rak'as."

Then getting up and going to the bucket, he loosened its cord and poured some water into a bowl, then performed a good ablution between the two extremes, not going to great length, and when he had done it fully he stood up and prayed. I got up, and when I had performed ablution I stood at his left side, whereupon he took me by the ear and made me go round to his right side. His prayer was altogether thirteen rak'as. Then he lay down and slept, and he snored as was his custom. When Bilal made the call to prayer for him he prayed without performing ablution, and his supplication included these words, “O God, place light in my heart, light in my eyesight, light in my hearing, light on my right hand, light on my left hand, light above me, light below me, light in front of me, light behind me, and grant me light." Some added, “and light in my tongue," and mentioned, “my joints, my flesh, my blood, my hair, my skin."

M. ad-Dukhan,2 and “About what do they ask one another?”3 
    1. A title given to the suras from 49 to the end, but several other suras are also mentioned: 37, 45, 47, 48, 50, 61, 67, 87, and 93. The name is most appropriately explained ay meaning that this is the section of the Qur’an which contains many shorter suras.
    2. Al-Qur’an; 94. As this is included as one of the suras in al Mufassal, it suggests that this section begins earlier than the first number mentioned in the note referred to above.
    3. Al-Qur'an; 78.
(Bukhari and Muslim.)
Hadith - 1137
Hudhaifa said he saw the Prophet praying at night, and he was saying, “God is most great (three times), Possessor of the kingdom, might, pomp and greatness.” Thereafter he began and recited al-Baqara (Al-Qur’an; 2) then bowed, his bowing lasting about the same length of time as his standing, and he was saying while bowing, “Glory be to my mighty Lord.” He then raised his head after bowing and stood about the same length of time as he bad spent in bowing, saying, “To my Lord be the praise.” Then he prostrated himself for about the same length of time as he had stood, and he was saying while prostrating himself, “Glory be to my Lord most high.” He then raised his head after the prostration and sat between the two prostrations about the same length of time as he had spent in his prostration, and he was saying, “My Lord, forgive me; my Lord, forgive me.” He then prayed four rak'as in which he recited al-Baqara, Al 'Imran, an-Nisa’, and al-Ma'idaor al-An‘am (Al-Qur’an; 2, 3, 4 and 5 and 6) Shu‘ba was doubtful which it was.

He would use the toothstick, perform ablution, and pray nine rak'as, sitting only during the eighth of them, then he would make mention of God, praise and supplicate Him, then he would get up without uttering the salutation and pray the ninth. After that he would sit, make mention of God, praise and supplicate Him, then utter a salutation loud enough for me to hear. He would then pray two rak'as sitting after uttering the salutation, and that made eleven rak'as, sonny. But when God’s Messenger grew old and became fleshy he observed a witr of seven, doing in the two rak'as, as he had done formerly, and that made nine, sonny. When God’s prophet prayed a prayer he liked to keep on observing it, but when sleep or pain made it impossible for him to get up during the night; he prayed twelve rak'as during the day. I am not aware of God’s prophet having recited the whole Qur’an in a night, or praying through a whole night till morning, or fasting a complete month, except Ramadan.” 
*i.e. the good characteristics included in the Qur’an were shown by the Prophet in his own life.

    1. The Arabic is qunut, which means 'being obedient’, or 'the act of standing’. It is used of certain supplications in the witr or at other times, but there is some disagreement about when these supplications may be made. The traditions in this chapter deal with the appropriate times.
    2. The reference is to an incident at Bi’r Ma'una in 4 A.H.

Next night he did not make us get up, but when the fifth remaining night came he made us get up for prayer till a half of the night had gone, so I said, “Messenger of God, I wish you had led us in supererogatory prayers during the whole of this night." He replied, “When a man prays with an imam till he goes away he is reckoned as having spent a night in prayer." On the fourth remaining night he did not make us get up till two-thirds of the night had passed. On the third remaining night he gathered his family, his wives and the people and prayed with us till we were afraid we would miss the falah (explaining, when asked, that the falah was the meal before daybreak). Then he did not make us get up for prayer during the remainder of the month.

He then made up his mind and collected them with Ubayy b. Ka‘b as imam. Afterwards I went out with him another night when the people were following the prayer of their reciter, and ‘Umar said, “This is a good innovation, but what you miss through sleeping is more excellent than what you are getting up for, meaning at the end of the night, for the people were getting up during the early part of the night.

Jabir said : God’s Messenger used to teach us how to ask God’s guidance about matters just as he used to teach as a sura of the Qur’an, saying: When any of you intends to do something he should pray two rak'as which are not compulsory, then say, “O God, I ask Thy guidance by Thy knowledge, I ask Thee for power by Thy power, and I ask Thee out of Thy great abundance, for Thou hast power and I have none, Thou knowest and I did not, and Thou art the One who is aware of the unseen. O God, if Thou knowest that this matter is good for me regarding my religion, my livelihood, and my future wellbeing (or he said, “my affairs in this world and the next”), ordain it for me and make it easy for me, then bless me in it. But if Thou knowest that this matter is bad for me regarding my religion, my livelihood, and my future wellbeing (or he said, “my affairs in this world and the next”), turn it away from me, turn me away from it, ordain good for me wherever it is, then make me pleased with it.” He said that he should name what he required.

Glory be to God, the Lord of the mighty throne. Praise be to God, the Lord of the universe. I ask Thee for words which will guarantee Thy mercy, actions which will make certain Thy forgiveness, a supply of every virtue, and freedom from every offence. Do not leave me a sin which Thou dost not pardon, a care which Thou dost not remove, or a want that meets with Thy pleasure which Thou dost not supply, O most merciful of the merciful ones.”

Ibn ‘Abbas told that the Prophet said to al-‘Abbas b. ‘Abd al- Muttalib: ‘Abbas my uncle, shall I not give you, shall I not present you, shall I not tell you, shall I not produce in you ten things, by your doing which God will forgive you your sin, first and last, old and new, involuntary and voluntary, small and great, secret and open? You should pray four rak'as reciting in each one Fatihat al-Kitab (Al-Qur’an; 1) and a sura and when you finish the recitation in the first rak'a you should say fifteen times while standing, “Glory be to God. Praise be to God. There is no god but God. God is most great.” Then you should bow and say it ten times while bowing. Then you should raise your head after bowing and say it ten times. Then you should get down in prostration and say it ten times while prostrating yourself. Then you should raise your head after prostrating yourself and say it ten times. ’ Then you should prostrate yourself and say it ten times, then raise your head and say it ten times. That is, seventy-five times in every rak'a. You should do that in four rak'as. If you can observe it once daily do so; if not, then once weekly; if not, then once a month; if not, then once a year; if not, then once in your lifetime. 
Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah and Baihaqi, in  ad-Da'awat al-kabir, transmitted it, and Tirmidhi transmitted something similar from Abu Rafi'.
Hadith - 1259
Abu Huraira told of hearing God’s Messenger say, “The first of his deeds for which a man will be taken into account on the day of resurrection will be his prayer. If it is sound he will be saved and successful, but if it is unsound he will be unfortunate and miserable. If any deficiency is found in his obligatory prayer the Lord who is blessed and exalted will issue instructions to consider whether His servant has said any voluntary prayers so that what is lacking in the obligatory prayer may be made up by it. Then the rest of his actions will be treated in the same fashion.” In a version it says, “Then zakat will be dealt with like that, and all his actions will be treated on the same principle.” 
Abu Dawud transmitted it, and Ahmad transmitted it from “a man”.

Hadith - 1282
Abu Huraira reported God’s Messenger as saying, “We who are last shall be first on the day of resurrection, although  were given the Book before us and we were given it after them. It follows that this was their day which was prescribed for them (meaning Friday), but they disagreed about it and God guided us to it. The people come after us with regard to it, the Jews observing the next day and the Christians the day following that.” 
(Bukhari and Muslim) In a version by Muslim he said, “We who are last shall be first on the day of resurrection, and we shall be the first to enter paradise although  . . .”, and he mentioned something similar up to the end.

Hadith - 1286
Abu Huraira said: I went out to at-Tur and met Ka'b al-Ahbar with whom I sat, he telling me about the Torah and I telling him about God's Messenger. One of the things I told him was that God's Messenger had said, “The best day on which the sun has risen is Friday; on it Adam was created, on it he was cast down , on it his repentance was accepted, on it he died, on it the last hour will come, on Friday every beast is on the outlook from dawn to sunrise from fear of the last hour, but not jinn and men, and it contains a time at which no Muslim will pray and ask anything from God without His giving him it." Ka'b said that was one day every year, but when I insisted that it was on every Friday Ka'b read the Torah and said that God's Messenger had spoken the truth. Abu Huraira said: I met ‘Abdallah b. Salam and told him of my meeting with Ka'b al-Ahbar and of what I had told him about Friday, telling him that Ka'b had said that was one day every year. ‘Abdallah b. Salam said that Ka'b had lied, but when I told him that Ka'b afterwards read the Torah and said that it was every Friday he said that Ka'b had spoken the truth. ‘Abdallah b. Salam then said that he knew what time it was, and when I asked him to tell me about it and not keep it to himself he replied that it was at the very end of Friday. I asked how that could be when God's Messenger had said, “No Muslim will pray in it . . . and he asked me if God’s Messenger had not said, “If anyone is seated waiting for the prayer he is engaged in the prayer until he observes it." When I replied that that was so he said that that was how it came about. 
Malik, Abu Dawud, Tirmidhi and Nasa’i transmitted it, and Ahmad transmitted it up to the statement that Ka'b had spoken the truth.

He was asked how that could be when his body had
decayed* and replied, "God has prohibited the earth from consuming the bodies of prophets.”
*The text here gives two alternative words, both with the same meaning, the first being aramta, and the second balita, the latter being the more common.
Abu Dawud, Nasa’i, Ibn Majah, Darimi and Baihaqi, in  ad-Da‘awat al-kabir, transmitted it.
Hadith - 1289
Abu Huraira reported God’s Messenger as saying, "The promised day is the day of resurrection, the day which is witnessed is the day of ‘Arafa, and the witness* is Friday on no more excellent day than which has the sun risen or set. It contains a time at which no believing worshipper will supplicate God for what is good without God answering him, or seek refuge from something without His giving him refuge from it.” 
* Al-Qur’an; 85:2 f.
Ahmad and Tirmidhi transmitted it, the latter saying that this is a gharib tradition known only among the traditions of Musa b. ‘Ubaida who is declared to be weak.
Hadith - 1290
Abu Lubaba b. ‘Abd al-Mundhir reported God’s Messenger as saying, "Friday is the lord of days and the chiefest of them in God’s sight, being greater in God's sight than the day of sacrifice and the day of breaking the fast. It has five distinguishing characteristics: on it God created Adam, on it God sent Adam down to the earth, on it God took Adam in death, it contains a time at which no one will ask for anything without God giving it, so long as he does not ask for anything unlawful, and on it the last hour will come. There is no angel near God’s presence, or sky, or earth, or winds, or mountains, or sea which do not fear Friday.” 
Ibn Majah transmitted it. Ahmad transmitted from Sa'd b. Mu'adh that one of the Ansar went to the Prophet and asked him to tell him about the good contained in Friday. He replied, "It has five distinguishing characteristics ...” and he carried on to the end of the tradition.

Abu Huraira said that when the Prophet was asked for what reason Friday got its name he replied, "Because on it the nature of your father Adam was fashioned, on it will take place the shout and the resurrection of the dead, on it the assault* will take place, and at the end of three hours in it there is a time at which anyone who makes supplication to God will be answered." 
* cf. Al-Qur’an, 44:16.

The angels are present on it, and no one will invoke a blessing on me without his blessing being submitted to me till he stops."

Ibn Majah transmitted it.

Daraqutni transmitted it.
Hadith - 1305
Salman reported God’s Messenger as saying, “If any man bathes on Friday, purifies himself as much as he can with ablution, anoints himself with oil, or puts on a touch of perfume which he has in his house, then goes out and, without squeezing between two men, prays what is prescribed for him, then remains silent when the imam speaks, his sins between that time and the next Friday will be forgiven him.” 
Bukhari transmitted it.
Hadith - 1306
Abu Huraira reported God's Messenger as saying, “If anyone bathes, then comes to the Friday prayer and prays what is fixed for him, then keeps silent till  finishes his sermon, then prays along with him, his sins between that time and the next Friday will be forgiven him, and three days more.” 
Muslim transmitted it.
Hadith - 1307
He reported God’s Messenger as saying, “If anyone performs ablution, doing it well, then comes to the Friday prayer, listens and keeps silent, his sins between that time and the next Friday will be forgiven him, with three days extra; but he who touches pebbles has caused an interruption (lagha).”* 
* This refers to little stones which one removes while engaged in salat. While Bukhari, al-'amal fis salat, 8, gives a tradition which allows smoothing the ground once only, this tradition treats the matter as unsuitable. Regarding this tradition Lisan al-'Arab, 22:118, says that lagha means ‘he has spoken', or ‘deviated from what is right,‘ or ‘has been frustrated', adding that the first is the basic meaning. The idea is evidently that the one who makes a sound by removing small stones during the prayer has hindered someone from hearing. Cf. Qur'an, 41:26.
Muslim transmitted it.
Hadith - 1308
He reported God's Messenger as saying, “When Friday comes the angels stand at the door of the mosque recording the people in the order of their arrival. Those who go out in the midday heat1 are treated like him who offers a sacrificial animal, 2 next like one who offers a cow, next a sheep, next a hen, next an egg. Then when the imam comes out they fold up their sheets and listen to the mention of God." 
    1. The word muhajjir which is used here may mean either one who goes out in the midday heat, or one who goes early.
    2. The word is badana, meaning either a she-camel or a cow which is sacrificed. Here it most probably means a she-camel, as other animals are mentioned immediately afterwards.
(Bukhari and Muslim.)
Hadith - 1309
He reported God's Messenger as saying, “When you tell your companion on Friday to be silent while the imam is preaching, you are guilty of idle talk."

Abu Sa'id and Abu Huraira reported God’s Messenger as saying, “If anyone bathes on a Friday, puts on his best clothes, applies a touch of perfume if he has any, then goes to the congregational prayer and takes care not to step over people, then prays what God has prescribed for him, then keeps silent from the time his imam comes out till he finishes his prayer, it will atone for his sins during the previous week." 
Abu Dawud transmitted it.
Hadith - 1312
Aus b. Aus reported God's Messenger as saying, “If anyone washes and bathes on Friday, goes out early* walking, not riding, goes near to the imam and listens without interrupting, he will have the reward of a year’s fasting and praying for every step he takes." 
*The text has bakkara wa 'btakara. Both words mean the same thing and are presumably both used to emphasise the idea of going out early.
Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud, Nasa’i and Ibn Majah transmitted it.

Hadith - 1319
‘Abdallah b. ‘Amr reported God’s Messenger as saying, “Three types attend Friday prayer; one is present in a frivolous way and that is all he gets from it; another comes with a supplication, he being a man who makes supplication to God who may grant or refuse his request as He wishes; another is present silently and quietly without stepping over a Muslim or annoying anyone, and that is an atonement for his sins till the next Friday and three days more, the reason being that God says, ‘He who does a good deed will have ten times as much’”(Al-Qur’an; 6:160). 
Abu Dawud transmitted it.
Hadith - 1320
Ibn ‘Abbas reported God’s Messenger as saying, “If anyone speaks on Friday while the imam is preaching, he is like an ass which carries books, (cf. Al-Qur'an; 62:5) and he who tells him to be quiet is not credited with the Friday prayer.”

I also saw hell. No such abominable sight have I ever seen as that which I saw today; and I observed that most of its inhabitants were women." They asked why that was and he replied that it was for their ingratitude (bi-kufrihinna). He was asked whether they disbelieved in God2 and replied, “They are ungrateful to their husbands and they are ungrateful for kindness. If you were to treat one of them kindly for ever and she later saw some defect in you, she would say she had never seen any good in you." 
    1. Literally, life.
    2. The word kufr means both ingratitude and unbelief, which explains why the remark was misunderstood.
(Bukhari and Muslim.)
Hadith - 1404
‘A'isha told a tradition similar to that of Ibn ‘Abbas and said: Then he prostrated himself for a long time, then departed and the sun had become clear. He preached to the people, and after praising and extolling God he said, “The sun and the moon are two of God’s signs; they are not eclipsed on account of anyone’s death or on account of anyone's birth, so when you see that supplicate God, declare His greatness, pray and give alms." He then said, “O people of Muhammad, I swear by God that no one is more indignant than God when His servant or handmaiden commits fornication. O people of Muhammad, I swear by God that if you knew what I know you would laugh little and weep much." 
(Bukhari and Muslim.)

Abu Musa said: There was an eclipse of the sun, and the Prophet got up in trepidation fearing that the last hour fiad come.

He then said, “These signs which God sends do not come on account of anyone’s death or on account of his birth, but God produces dread in His servants by means of them. So when you see anything of that nature, apply yourselves to making mention of Him, supplication of Him and asking pardon of Him."

‘Abd ar-Rahmin b. Samura said: During the lifetime of God’s Messenger was shooting some of my arrows in Medina when an eclipse of the sun took place.

He then began to glorify God, to acknowledge that He is the only God, to declare His greatness, to express His praise and make supplication till the eclipse came to an end. When the eclipse was over he recited two suras and prayed two rak'as.

An-Nu‘man b. Bashir said that when a solar eclipse took place in the time of God’s Messenger he began to pray a series of pairs of rak'as, making requests at the end of them till the sun became clear. 
Abu Dawud transmitted it. In a version by Nasa’i it says that when the sun was eclipsed the Prophet prayed as Muslims normally do, bowing and prostrating himself. Another version by him says that when a solar eclipse took place one day the Prophet went out quickly to the mosque and prayed till it cleared. Then he said, “The people in pre-Islamic times used to say that the sun and moon were eclipsed only on account of the death of a great man, but the sun and moon are not eclipsed on account of anyone’s death or on account of his birth, but they are two of God’s creatures. God produces in His creation what He wills; so when either of them is eclipsed pray till it clears or till God produces something.

Having declared God’s greatness and expressed His praise, he said, “You have complained of drought in your abodes and of delay in receiving rain at the beginning of its season, but God has ordered you to supplicate Him and has promised that He would answer your prayers.” Then he said, “Praise be to God, the Lord of the universe, the Compassionate, the Merciful, the Master of the day of judgment. There is no god but God who does what He wishes. O God, Thou art God than whom there is no god, the Rich, while we are the poor. Send down rain upon us and make what Thou
sendest down a strength and satisfaction for us for a time.” He then raised his hands and kept raising them till the whiteness under his armpits was visible. He then turned his back to the people and inverted (or, turned round) his cloak while keeping his hands aloft. He then faced the people, descended and prayed two rak'as. God then produced a cloud and a storm of thunder and lightning came on. Then it rained by God’s permission, and before he reached his mosque streams were flowing. When he saw the speed with which the people sought shelter he laughed till his back teeth were visible. Then he said, “I testify that God is omnipotent and that I am God’s servant and Messenger.”
