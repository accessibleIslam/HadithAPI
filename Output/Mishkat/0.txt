Hadith - 4428
‘Umar b. al-Khattab, for whom God’s good pleasure is prayed, reported God’s Messenger, to whom may God’s blessings and safe-keeping be granted, as saying: “Deeds are to be judged only by intentions, and a man will have only what he intended. When one’s emigration is to God and His Messenger, his emigration is to God and His Messenger; but when his emigration is to a worldly end at which he aims, or to a woman whom he marries, his emigration is to that to which he emigrated.” 
(Bukhari and Muslim.)
