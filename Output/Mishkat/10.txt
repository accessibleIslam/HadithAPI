Hadith - 2398
Abu Huraira told that God's messenger addressed them saying, “Pilgrimage (In what follows I have used the word "pilgrimage” where only the hajj is intended; but when reference is made to both hajj and ’umra the Arabic words are used without translation to avoid misunderstanding.) has been ordained for you people, so perform it.” A man asked whether it should be performed annually, but God’s messenger gave no reply till he had asked the question three times. Then he said, “If I were to say that it should, it would be obligatory and you would not be able to perform it,” after which he said, “Leave me alone as long as I have said nothing to you, for your predecessors perished simply on account of their much questioning and their disagreement with their prophets. But when I command you to do anything, obey it as much as you can; and when I forbid you to do anything, leave it alone.”
Muslim transmitted it.

(The word used here is sarura. The meaning is strictly "one who does not perform the pilgrimage." It is explained as coming from sarr which indicates the act of confining, or withholding.

Hadith - 2424

Bukhari and Muslim.
Hadith - 2437
Ibn ‘Umar said that at the Farewell Pilgrimage God’s messenger performed the ‘umra first and the hajj later (The phrase used is tamata'a bil-’umra ilal-hajj which indicates gaining the advantage of the ‘umra and waiting till the time for the hajj comes without requiring to wear the ihram during the intervening period.

Hadith - 2446
Jabir b. ‘Abdallah said: God’s messenger remained in Medina nine years, during which he had not performed the hajj, then made a public announcement in the tenth year to the effect that God’s messenger was about to perform the hajj. Large numbers came to Medina, and we went out with him. When we reached Dhul Hulaifa, Asma’ daughter of ‘Umais, gave birth to Muhammad b. Abu Bakr and sent to God’s messenger asking what she was to do. He replied, “Bathe, bandage your private parts with a cloth, and put on the ihram.” God’s messenger then prayed in the mosque, and after he had mounted al-Qaswa' and his she-camel stood erect with him on its back at al-Baida’, he raised his voice declaring God’s unity and saying, “Labbaik, O God, labbaik labbaik; Thou hast no partner; labbaik; praise and grace are Thine and the dominion; Thou hast no partner.” Jabir said : We did not express our intention of performing anything but the hajj, being unaware of the ‘umra  said: The total of those sacrificial animals brought by ‘Ali from the Yemen and of those brought by the Prophet was a hundred. Then all the people, except the Prophet and those who had with them sacrificial animals, removed the ihram and clipped their hair. When yaum at-tarwiya (The 8th of Dhul Hijja, the day when pilgrims leave Mecca and go to Mina. The name is commonly explained as meaning that this was the day when the pilgrims provided themselves with a supply of water for the arid journey before them) came they went towards Mina having put on the ihram for the hajj, and the Prophet rode and prayed there the noon, afternoon, sunset, evening and dawn prayers. After that he waited a little till the sun rose, and gave orders for a tent of hair to be set up for him at Namira (A place or a hill near ‘Arafa). God’s messenger then set out, and Quraish did not doubt that he would observe a halt at the sacred site (At al-Muzdalifa, al-Mash'ar al-haram, a hill sacred to the god Ouzah in pre-lslamic times), as Quraish used to do in the pre-Islamic period ; but he passed on till he came to ‘Arafa and found that the tent had been set up for him at Namira. There he dismounted, and when the sun had passed the meridian he ordered al- Qaswa’ to be brought, and when it was saddled for him he went down into the valley and addressed the people, saying, “Your lives and your property must be respected by one another like the sacredness of this day of yours in this month of yours in this town of yours. Everything pertaining to the pre-Islamic period has been put under my feet, and claims for blood-vengeance belonging to the pre-lslamic period have been abolished. The first of those murdered among us whose blood-vengeance I remit is the son of Rabi'a b. al-Harith (Rabi’a was a grandson of 'Abd al-Muttalib. The name of the child who had been killed is variously given as Adam, Tammam and Iyas. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr says Adam is a mistake, but does not commit himself to either of the other two names) who was suckled among the B. Sa'd and killed by Hudhail. The usury of the pre-Islamic period is abolished, and the first of our usury I abolish is that of ‘Abbas b. ‘Abd al-Muttalib, for it is all abolished. Show fear towards God regarding women, for you have got them under God’s security, and have the right to intercourse with them by God's word. They must not bring into your houses anyone whom you dislike, but if they do that beat them, though not severely. You are responsible for providing them with their food and clothing in a fitting manner. I have left among you something, i.e. God’s Book, by which, if you hold to it, you will never again go astray. You will be asked about me, so what will you say?" They replied, “We testify that you have conveyed and fulfilled the message and given counsel. ” Then raising his forefinger towards the sky and pointing it at the people, he said, “O God, be witness ; O God, be witness,” saying it three times. Bilal then uttered the call to prayer, and the iqama, and he prayed the noon prayer; he then uttered the iqama and he prayed the afternoon prayer, engaging in no prayer between the two. He then mounted his camel and came to the place of standing, making his she-camel al-Qaswa’ turn its back to the rocks and having the path taken by those who went on foot (The Arabic is Habl al-mushat, which is variously explained as above, or as ‘the concourse of horse on foot', or as the name of a place.) in front of him. He faced the qibla and remained standing till sunset when the yellow light had somewhat gone and the disc of the sun had disappeared. He took Usama up behind him and went quickly till he came to al-Muzdalifa, where he prayed the sunset and the evening prayer with one adhan and two iqamas without saying ‘Glory be to God' between them. He then lay down till dawn and prayed the dawn prayer with an adhan and an iqama when the morning light was clear. He then mounted al-Qaswa’ and when he came to the sacred site he faced the qibla, supplicated God, declared His greatness, His uniqueness and His unity, and kept standing till the daylight was very clear. He then went quickly before the sun rose, taking al-Fadl b. ‘Abbas behind him, and came to the valley of Muhassir (Between al-Muzdalifa and Mini). He urged the camel a little and following the middle road which comes out at the greatest jamra (Jamra, originally a pebble, is applied to a heap of stones, of which there are three in the valley of Mina. One of the rites of the hajj is to throw small stones at them), he came to the jamra which is beside the tree. At this he threw seven small pebbles (Literally, 'pebbles that are thrown’: used to indicate small pebbles about the size of a date-stone), saying “God is most great” each time he threw a pebble. He threw them from the bottom of the valley, then went to the place of sacrifice and sacrificed sixty-three victims with his own hand. Then he gave some to ‘Ali who sacrificed the remainder, and he shared with him in his sacrificial animals. After that he ordered that a piece of flesh from each victim should be put in a pot, and when it was cooked the two of them ate some of it and drank some of its broth. Then God’s messenger mounted, and going quickly to the House, prayed the noon prayer in Mecca. He came to the B. ‘Abd al-Muttalib who were supplying water at Zamzam and said, “Draw water, B. ‘Abd al-Muttalib. Were it not that people would take from you the right to draw water, I would draw it along with you.” So they handed him a bucket and he drank from it. 
Muslim transmitted it.
Hadith - 2447
‘A'isha said: We went out with the Prophet at the Farewell Pilgrimage, some of us raising our voices in the talbiya for an ‘umra and others for a hajj. When we came to Mecca God s messenger said, “Those who have raised their voices in the talbiya for an ‘umra and have not brought sacrificial animals may put off the ihram, but those who have put on the ihram for an 'umra and brought sacrificial animals must raise their voices in the talbiya for the hajj along with the ’umra, and not put it off till they do so after performing them both ; (a version has “and not put it off till they do so after sacrificing their animals”) and those who have raised their voices in the talbiya for a hajj must complete their hajj." She said: I menstruated, and did not go round the House or run between as-Safa and al-Marwa, and I continued in my courses till the day of ‘Arafa. I had raised my voice in the talbiya only for an ’umra, but the Prophet ordered me to undo my hair, comb it, raise my voice in the talbiya for the hajj, and let the ‘umra go, which I did, and performed my hajj. He sent ‘Abd ar-Rahman b. Abu Bakr along with me and ordered me to make an ‘umra in place of the one I had missed from at-Tan‘im. She said: Those who had raised their voices in the talbiya for the ‘umra put off the ihram after making the circuit of the House and running between as-Safa and al-Marwa, then made a circuit after they returned from Mina, but those who combined the hajj and the ‘umra made only one circuit. 
(Bukharl and Muslim.)
Hadith - 2448
‘Abdallah b. ‘Umar said: At the Farewell Pilgrimage God’s messenger put on the ihram first for the 'umra and afterwards for the hajj, and drove the sacrificial animals along with him from Dhul Hulaifa. He first raised his voice in the talbiya for the ‘umra and afterwards he did so for the hajj, and the people along with the Prophet did it first for the ‘umra and afterwards for the hajj. Some of the people had brought sacrificial animals and others had not, so when the Prophet came to Mecca he said to the people, “Those of you who have brought sacrificial animals must not treat as lawful anything which has become unlawful for you till you complete your hajj ; but those of you who have not brought sacrificial animals should go round the House and between as-Safa and al-Marwa, clip your hair, put off the ihram, and afterwards raise your voice in the talbiya for the hajj and bring sacrificial animals. Those who cannot get sacrificial animals should fast three days during the hajj and seven days when they return to their families.” He performed the circumambulation when he came to Mecca, first touching the corner (The corner of the Ka'ba containing the Black Stone), then running during three circuits and walking during four, and when he had finished his circumambulation of the House he prayed two rak'as at the Station (Maqam Ibrahim), then giving the salutation, and departing, he went to as-Safa and went seven times between as-Safa and al-Marwa. After that he did not treat anything as lawful which had become unlawful for him till he had completed his hajj, sacrificed his animals on the day of sacrifice, gone quickly and performed the circumambulation of the House, after which all that had been unlawful became lawful for him. Those people who had brought sacrificial animals did as God’s messenger did. 
(Bukharl and Muslim.)
Hadith - 2449
Ibn ‘Abbas reported God’s messenger as saying, “This is an ‘umra which we have treated as a complete observance, so those who have no sacrificial animals may come completely out of the sacred state, for the ‘umra has become incorporated in the hajj till the day of resurrection." 
Muslim transmitted it.
Hadith - 2450
‘Ata’ said that he and some people along with him heard Jabir b. ‘Abdallah say, “We, Muhammad’s companions, raised our voices in the talbiya for the hajj alone." ‘Ata’ reported Jabir as saying: The Prophet came on the fourth of Dhul Hijja and commanded us to put off the ihram, saying (as reported by ‘Ata’), “Come out of the sacred state and have intercourse with your wives." Ata’ explained that this was not by way of making intercourse obligatory, but by way of making it lawful. As it was only five days before they were due at ‘Arafa, they said he had ordered them to go in to their wives and so they would come to ‘Arafa with their penises dripping with prostatic fluid. He said that Jabir made a gesture, moving his hand, and he could still imagine himself looking at him (Perhaps the gesture was meant to indicate that they could have shaken off the fluid). The Prophet then got up among them and said, “You know that I am the most godfearing, truthful and pious one among you. Were it not that I have sacrificial animals I would have removed the ihram as you are doing, and had I known beforehand about my affair what I have come to know later I would not have brought sacrificial animals ; so remove the ihram.'’ They did so, hearing and obeying. ‘Ata’ quoted Jabir as saying that ‘Ali arrived after his expedition to collect the poor rate and he asked him for what he had raised his voice in the talbiya. He replied that he had done it for the same purpose as the Prophet, so God's messenger said to him, “Bring the sacrificial animals and remain in the sacred state.” He said that ‘Ali brought sacrificial animals for him and that Suraqa b. Malik b. Jush'um asked God’s messenger whether this applied to that particular year or, forever, to which he replied that it was applicable forever. 
Muslim transmitted it.
Hadith - 2451
‘A’isha said : God’s messenger came on the fourth or fifth of Dhul Hijja and came to visit me in a state of anger. I said, “Who has angered you, messenger of God? May God send him to hell!” He replied, “Are you not aware that I gave the people a command, yet they are confused? If I had known beforehand about my affair what I have come to know later, I would not have brought the sacrificial animals with me, but would have waited to buy some, and then I could have put off the ihram as they have done.” 
Muslim transmitted it.

If anyone goes round and talks while doing so, he will wade in mercy like him who wades in water.”( Mirqat 3, 215 says Tibi understands 'talks’ to refer to the phrases mentioned above, and trusts this as a repetition of what has preceded ; but Ibn Hajar understands it as referring to other words and so meriting a lesser reward.

Mirqat, 3, 219 omits ‘He was : asked ... replied’.

It is said that this name was applied to them because they boasted of their bravery and endurance. Another explanation is that they observed rites of standing only at Hamss', which is the Ka’ba) but the rest of the Arabs used to stand at ‘Arafa ; then when Islam came God most high commanded His Prophet to go to ‘Arafat (Both 'Arafa and its plural‘Arafat are used. It is rather peculiar to find bcth used In the same tradition) and stand there, then go quickly from it. That is in accordance with the words of Him who is great and glorious, “Then go quickly from where the people went quickly.”(Qur’an, 2, 199)
Bukhari and Muslim.
Hadith - 2492
‘Abbas b. Mirdas said that God’s messenger prayed for pardon for his people on the late evening of ‘Arafa and received the reply, “I have forgiven them all but acts of oppression, for I shall exact recompense for him who is wronged from his oppressor.” He said, “O my Lord, if Thou wilt Thou mayest give the oppressed some of paradise and forgive the oppressor,” but he did not receive a reply that evening. So he repeated the supplication at al-Muzdalifa in the morning and was given an answer to what he asked, whereupon he laughed (or he said that he smiled). Abu Bakr and ‘Umar then said to him, “You for whom we would give our fathers and mothers as ransom, what has made you laugh, for this is not a time at which you have been accustomed to laugh ? May God give you cause for laughter all your life !” He replied, “When God’s enemy, Iblls, knew that God who is great and glorious had answered my supplication and forgiven my people, he took some earth and began to throw it on his head crying out ‘Woe and destruction.’ The sight of his distress made me laugh.”

Our guidance differs from that of the worshippers of idols and those who attribute partners to God.”

Salim said, “If you wish to keep to the sunna, observe the prayer in the noonday heat on the day of ‘Arafa.” ‘Abdallah b. ‘Umar then said, “He has spoken the truth ; they were accustomed to combine the noon and the afternoon prayer in accordance with the sunna.” Ibn Shihab asked Salim whether God's messenger did that, and Salim replied, “In doing that do they follow anything but his sunna?”

Hadith - 2547
Abu Bakra said that the Prophet gave them the following sermon on the day of sacrifice: “Time has completed a cycle to the form of the day when God created the heavens and the earth. The year contains twelve months of which four are sacred, three of them consecutive, viz. Dhul Qa'da, Dhul Hijja. and Muharram, and also Rajab of Mudar which comes between Jumada and Sha'ban.”( The month Rajab is here connected with the North Arabian tribe of Mudar because they are said to have honoured it greatly and never to have broken its sacred nature. The precise reference to its place among the months is said’to be for the purpose of removing any doubt about it owing to the earlier practice of periodically intercalating a month) He asked, “What month is this?" and when the people replied that God and His messenger knew best, he remained silent so that they thought he would give it a new name, but he said, “Is it not Dhul Hijja?" and they replied that it was. He asked, “What town is this?" and when the people replied that God and His apostle knew best, he remained silent so that they thought he would give it a new name, but he said, “Is it not al-Balda?”( This word occurs a number of times in the Qur’an in the general sense of a district, but in 27, 91 it is used particularly of Mecca which is there called “this district (balda)". In the tradition the word seems to be used as if it were a proper name) and they replied that it was. He asked, “What day is this?” and when the people replied that God and His messenger knew best, he remained silent so that they thought he would give it a new name, but he said, “Is it not the day of sacrifice?" and they replied that it was. He said, “Your lives, property and honour must be regarded by you with a sacredness like that of this day of yours in this town of yours in this month of yours. You will meet your Lord, and He will ask you about your deeds. O, do not revert after my death to being people who are astray, beheading one another. Have I delivered the message ?" When they replied that he had he said, “O God, testify ; and let him who is present convey it to him who is absent, for many a one to whom a message is conveyed has a more retentive memory than the one who hears.” 
Bukhari and Muslim.
Hadith - 2548
Wabara said he asked Ibn ‘Umar when he should throw pebbles at the jamras, to which he replied, “Throw them when your imam does so.” He repeated the question and received the reply, “We used to wait for the proper time, and when the sun passed the meridian we threw them.” 
Bukhari transmitted it.
Hadith - 2549
Salim told that Ibn ‘Umar used to throw seven pebbles at the nearest1 jamra, saying “God is most great” after throwing each one. He would then go forward into the interior of the valley and after standing facing the qibla for a long time, making supplication and raising his hands, he would throw seven pebbles at the middle one, saying “God is most great” as often as he threw a pebble. He would then turn to the left and go farther into the valley, and after facing the qibla, making supplication, raising his hands and standing for a long time, he would throw seven pebbles at the jamra of the ‘Aqaba from the bottom of the wadi, saying “God is most great” each time be threw a pebble, but he did not stand beside it. Then he would depart and say, “This is how I saw the Prophet do it.”

Hadith - 2551
Ibn ‘Abbas said that when God’s messenger came to the place for supplying water and asked for some, al-‘Abbas said, “Goto your mother, Fadl, and bring God’s messenger something to drink from her.” He asked again for water, and he said, “Messenger of God, they are putting their hands in it.” He asked once more and drank some of it. He then went to Zamzam where they were exerting themselves in supplying water and said, “Go ahead, for you are engaged in a good work.” Then pointing to his shoulder he said, “Were it not that you would be overpowered, I would go down and put the rope on this.” (This means that if the Prophet were seen drawing water from Zamzam himself others would think they had the right to do the same, and chose who had the office of drawing water would lose their privilege)
Bukhari transmitted it.
Hadith - 2552
Anas said that the Prophet prayed the noon, afternoon, sunset and evening prayer, after which he had a sleep, in al-Muhassab. (The valley opening on al-Abtah between Mecca and Mina ; so called because of the pebbles in it) He then rode to the House and performed the circumambulation.

He asked where he had prayed the afternoon prayer on yaum an-nafr,( There are two days with this name, the first being the 12th of Dhul Hijja and the second the following day. The second of these is said to be the one referred to here) and he replied that it was in al-Abtah.(The part of the wadi of Mecca with small pebbles) He then said, “Do as your commanders do.” 
Bukhari and Muslim.
Hadith - 2554

He set out, and when passing the House he performed the circumambulation before the morning prayer, then went off to Medina. 
I did not find this tradition in what the two shaikhs transmitted, but in Abu Dawud’s version, with a slight difference at the end.
Hadith - 2556

‘A’isha told that Safiya began to menstruate on the night before yaum an-nafr and said, “It looks as if I shall detain you;” whereupon the Prophet said, “How unlucky and annoying you are!” He asked whether she had performed the circumambulation on the day of sacrifice, and on being informed that she had, he told her to set off. 
Bukhari and Muslim.
Hadith - 2558
‘Amr b. al-Ahwas said he heard God’s messenger ask at the Farewell Pilgrimage, “What day is this?” and receive the reply that it was the day of the greatest pilgrimage. He then said, “Your lives, property and honour must be regarded by you with a sacredness like that of this day of yours in this town of yours. No wrongdoer must do wrong to himself,( This phrase has given rise to different explanations. Mirqat, 3, 250 prefers the one which says that this is a command not to wrong one another As this is a cause of wrongdoing to oneself the command has been worded in this manner) no wrongdoer must do wrong to his child, nor any child to his parent. The devil has despaired of ever being worshipped in this town of yours, but he will receive obedience in your actions which you consider of little importance and will be satisfied with that.”
Ibn Majah and Tirmidhi transmitted it, the latter saying that it is sahih.
Hadith - 2559

Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah transmitted it.
Hadith - 2562
‘A’isha reported the Prophet as saying, “When any of you throws pebbles at the jamra of the ‘Aqaba every thing but women becomes lawful for him.”

Hadith - 2563
She said that God’s messenger hastened to Mecca at the ending of the day when he prayed the noon prayer. He then returned to Mina and remained there over the nights of the. tashriq days. (The 11th, 12th and 13th of Dhul Hijja. The name tashriq is explained as a reference to pieces the flesh of the sacrifices which pilgrims dry in the sun) He would throw pebbles at the jamra when the sun passed the meridian, throwing seven at each jamra and saying “God is most Great” with each pebble. He would stand a long time at the first and second and make supplication, but while he threw pebbles at the third, he did not stand beside it.

When they refused, he took it, chased the wild ass and killed it. Both he and they ate it, but afterwards they repented, so when they caught up on God's messenger they asked him about it. He asked if they had any of it with them, and when they told him they had a leg, the Prophet took it and ate it.

Its thorns are not to be cut, its game is not to be molested, things dropped are to be picked up only by one who publicly announces it, and its fresh herbage is not to be cut.” Ibn ‘Abbas made the suggestion, “Except the rush, messenger of God, for it is useful for their blacksmiths and for their houses.” He then said, “Except the rush.”

Sa‘id when he was sending troops to Mecca (The reference is to an expedition against 'Abdallah b. az-Zubair): Let me tell you something, commander, which God’s messenger said on the day following the Conquest. My ears heard it, my heart has retained it, and my eyes saw him when he spoke it. After praising and extolling God he said, “God, not men, has made Mecca sacred, so it is not allowable for a man who believes in God and in the last day to shed blood in it, or lop a tree in it. If anyone seeks licence to do so on the ground that God’s messenger fought in it, tell him that God has given permission to His messenger but not to you. He gave him permission only during one hour on one day, and its sacredness has been restored to it like what it was yesterday. Let him who is present convey the information to him who is absent." Abu Shuraih was asked what ‘Amr had replied, and said he had replied, “I am better informed of that than you, Abu Shuraih.' The sacred territory does not give refuge to one who is disobedient, or one who flies when he has shed blood, or one who flies because of a fault (kharba).” (The word is used of a vice) 
Bukhari and Muslim. In Bukhari’s work kharba is said to mean a crime.

Because of the difficulty some have suggested that Uhud should be read instead of Thaur, but others feel that that is unjustifiable.) so if anyone produces an innovation in it, or gives protection to an innovator, the curse of God, the angels, and all men will rest upon him, and no repentance or ransom (Lane in his Lexicon gives a variety of meanings for this phrase, la yuqbal minhu sarf wald 'adl. The one used above seems the most suitable here) will be accepted from him. The protection granted by Muslims is one and must be respected by the humblest of them, so if anyone breaks a covenant made by a Muslim the curse of God, the angels, and all men will rest upon him and no repentance or ransom will be accepted from him. If anyone gives the rights of inheritance to people without the permission of his masters, (This is explained in relation to a slave who has been set free, for the rights of inheritance still belong to his master who set him free. Cf. Book 12, ch. 6, third tradition) the curse of God, the angels, and all men will rest upon him, and no repentance or ransom will be accepted from him.’’ 
Bukhari and Muslim. A version given by both of them says, “ If anyone makes a false claim to paternity or to being a client, the curse of God, the angels and all men will rest upon him, and no repentance or ransom will be accepted from him.”

Sa‘d reported God’s messenger as saying, “I declare sacred the territory between the two lava plains of Medina, so that its large thorn trees may not be cut down, or its game killed.” He also said, “Medina is best for them if they only knew. No one leaves it through dislike of it without God putting in it someone better than he in place of him, and no one will remain there in spite of its hardship and distress without my being an intercessor (or witness) on his behalf on the day of resurrection." 
Muslim transmitted it.

He told that when the people saw the first fruits they brought them to the Prophet, and when he received them he said, "O God, bless us in our fruits; bless us in our city; bless us in our sa‘; and bless us in our mudd. O God, Abraham was Thy servant, friend and prophet, and I am Thy servant and prophet. He made supplication to Thee on behalf of Mecca, and I make on behalf of Medina the same supplication as he made on behalf of Mecca and as much again." He would then call to him the youngest child and give him those fruits.

Bukhari and Muslim.
Hadith - 2624
Jabir b. Samura told that he heard God’s messenger say, “God called Medina Taba.”( Taj al-'Arus says the objection to the name Yathrib was owing to the fact that the root from which this name comes has the meaning of corruption. Therefore Taba, which comes from a root meaning to be good, sweet, or pure, was considered better. Other forms which have been used are Taiba, al-Mutayyaba (or al-Mutayyiba))
Muslim transmitted it.
Hadith - 2625
Jabir b. ‘Abdallah told of a desert Arab who had sworn allegiance to God’s messenger, but who, when he suffered from a bout of fever in Medina, came to the Prophet and said, "Cancel my oath of allegiance, Muhammad;” but God’s messenger refused.

His patrons came to him and spoke to him about it, but he replied, “God’s messenger declared this sacred territory to be sacred, saying that if anyone caught someone hunting in it he should take from him what he had, so I will not return to you a provision which God’s messenger has given me; but if you wish I shall pay you its value.” 
Abu Dawud transmitted it.
Hadith - 2634

Abu Dawud transmitted it. Muhyi as-Sunna said Wajj was mentioned by some as being in the neighbourhood of at-Ta’if. (There is another sentence here which cannot easily be fitted in with the translation. It says that al-Khattabi used annahu in place of annaha. In the preceding phrase annaha is used with reference to Wajj. The point of the extra sentence is that al-Khattabi used the masculine pronominal suffix in place of the feminine)
