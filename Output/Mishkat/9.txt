When the people separate they ascend up to heaven, and God who knows best asks them where they have come from. They reply, “We have come from Thy servants on the earth who are extolling and magnifying Thee, declaring Thy unity, praising Thee and making request of Thee.” He says, “For what are they asking me?” and they reply, “They are asking Thee for Thy paradise.” He asks whether they have seen His paradise, and when they reply, “No my Lord.” He asks how they would act if they had seen His paradise. They say, “They are also seeking Thy protection.” He asks, “From what are they seeking my protection?” and they reply, “From Thy fire.” He asks whether they have seen His fire, and when they reply that they have not, He asks how they would act if they had seen His fire. They say, “They are also asking Thy forgiveness,” to which He replies, “I have forgiven them, given them what they have asked for, and protected them from what they sought protection.” They say, “My Lord, so and so, a sinner, is among them, who just happening to pass by sat down with them.” He replies, “Him also I have forgiven. They are the people by reason of whom their associate will not be miserable.”

Muslim transmitted it. In his book, in all the versions on the authority of Musa al-Juhani, “or . . . will be removed” is given, but Abu Bakr al-Burqani said that Shu'ba, Abu ‘Awana and Yahya b. Sa'id al-Qattan quoted Musa’s authority, saying “ and . . . will be removed.” Thus it is stated in al-Humaidi’s book.

He whom you are supplicating is nearer to each of you than the neck of his riding-beast.” Abu Musa said: I was behind him saying within myself, “There is no might and no power except in God,” and he said, “‘Abdallah b. Qais,* would you like me to guide you to one of the treasures of paradise?” On my replying that I certainly would, he said that it was, “There is no might and no power except in God.”

My servants, you are all straying except those whom I guide, but if you ask for my guidance I will guide you. My servants, you are all hungry except those whom I feed, but if you ask me for food I will feed you. My servants, you are all naked except those whom I have clothed, but if you ask me for clothing I will clothe you. My servants, you are all sinning night and day, but I forgive all sins, so if you ask me forgiveness I will forgive you. My servants, you will not be able to injure me and succeed in such a purpose, neither will you be able to benefit me and succeed in such a purpose. My servants, even if the first and last of you, men and jinn, were as pious as the one with the most pious heart among you, that would not cause any increase in my dominion. My servants, if the first and last of you, men and jinn, were as wicked as the man with the most wicked heart among you, that would not cause any diminution in my dominion. My servants, if the first and last of you, men and jinn, were to stand in one plain and make request of me and I were to give every man what he asked, that would make no more diminution of what I possess than a needle would when put into the sea. My servants, they are only your deeds which I put to your account and then pay you in full for them; so let him who experiences good praise God, and let him whose experience is different blame no one but himself.” 
Muslim transmitted it.

He then began to make enquiry, and a man told him to go to such and such a village. When he was upon the point of death he arose to go towards it, and the angels of mercy and the angels of punishment disputed over him. God then told the one village to come near and the other to remove to a distance, and told the angels to measure the distance between them. He was found to be the distance of a span nearer to the one towards which he was going, and so he was forgiven.

He said, “The believer sees in his sins as though he were sitting under a mountain which he fears may fall on him, but the profligate sees his sins like a fly which has passed over his nose and which he has brushed away with his hand.” Then he said that he heard God’s mes­ senger say, “God rejoices more over the repentance of a believer than a man who goes down to a desert and dangerous district with his riding- beast which carries his food and drink, who lays down his head and sleeps for a time, then awakening and finding that his riding-beast has gone, looks for it, and when distressed by heat and thirst or what God wills, says he will return to the place where he was and sleep till he dies, lays his head on his arm to die, then awakens and sees his riding-beast beside him with his food and drink on it. God rejoices more intensely over the repentance of a believing servant than this man does over his riding-beast and his provisions.”

When he died they did what he had commanded them, but God gave command to the sea and it gathered what was in it, and He gave command to the land and it gathered what was in it. He then asked him, "Why did you do this?" and he replied, “From fear of Thee, my Lord, but Thou knowest best.” Then He pardoned him. 
(Bukhari and Muslim.)
Hadith - 2267
‘Umar b. al-Khattab said that captives came to the Prophet among whom was a woman whose breast was oozing with milk. She was running, and when she found a boy among the captives she took him, put him to her breast and suckled him. Then the Prophet said to us, “Do you think this woman will cast her child into the fire?” We replied, “No, so long as is she in a position not to do so.” He said, “God is more merciful to His servants than this woman is to her child.” 
(Bukhari and Muslim.)
Hadith - 2268
Abu Huraira reported God’s messenger as saying, “None of you will be rescued by his works.” He was asked if not even he would, and replied, “Not even I unless God covers me with His mercy; but if you keep to the straight path, are moderate, pray morning and evening and part of the night, and earnestly practise moderation, you will reach .” 
(Bukhari and Muslim.)

Abu Sa'id reported God’s messenger as saying, “When a man accepts Islam sincerely God removes from him every sin he has previously committed. After that there will be requital, a good deed getting ten to seven hundred times as much and many times more, and an evil deed getting a punishment equivalent to it, unless God overlooks it.”
Bukhari transmitted it.
Hadith - 2271
Ibn ‘Abbas reported God’s messenger as saying, “God records the good deeds and the evil deeds. If anyone intends to do a good deed but does not do it, God enters it for him in His record as a complete good deed: and if he intends to do a good deed and does it, God enters it for him in His record as ten to seven hundred and many more times as much. If anyone intends to do an evil deed and does not do it, God enters it for him in His record as a complete good deed; but if he intends to do it and does it, God records it for him as one evil deed.”
(Bukhari and Muslim.)
Hadith - 2272
‘Uqba b. ‘Amir reported God’s messenger as saying, “One who does evil deeds and afterwards does good deeds is like a man who was wearing a tight coat of mail which choked him, then did a good deed and a ring was loosened, then did another and another was loosened, so that it fell at last to the ground.” 
It is transmitted in Sharh as-sunna.
Hadith - 2273
Abud Darda’ told of his hearing the Prophet delivering a discourse on the pulpit and saying, “He who fears standing before his Lord will have two paradises.” He asked, “Even if he commits fornication and even if he steals, messenger of God?” but he said a second time, “He who fears standing before his Lord will have two paradises.” He asked a second time, “Even if he commits fornication and even if he steals, messenger of God?” and he said a third time, “He who fears standing before his Lord will have two paradises.” He asked a third time, “Even if he commits fornication and even if he steals, messenger of God?” to which he replied, “Even in spite of Abud Darda’.” 
Ahmad transmitted it.
Hadith - 2274
‘Amir ar-Ram said: While we were with him, meaning with the Prophet, a man came forward wearing a garment and carrying something wrapped up in his hand. He said, “Messenger of God, I passed by a thicket of trees in which I heard the chirping of young birds, so I took them and put them in my garment. Their mother came and flew round over my head, so I uncovered them to let her see them, and when she alighted on them I wrapped them all up in my garment, and these are what I have with me.” He gave command to put them down, and I did so,* but their mother would not leave them, whereupon God’s messenger said, “Do you wonder at the pity of the young birds’ mother for her young? By Him who sent me with the truth, God shows more pity towards His servants than the mother of young birds shows to her young. Take them back and put them where you got them, their mother being with them.” So he took them back. 
*The use of the first person seems strange here. The command was given to the man who was holding the bundle, and so one would have expected "and he did so." This is not the kind of sentence in which the change of person frequently used in Arabic style seems natural. As the text stands it would seem that ‘Amir took the bundle from the man and laid it down.
Abu Dawud transmitted it.
Hadith - 2275
‘Abdallah b. ‘Umar said: When we were with the Prophet on one of his expeditions he came upon some people and asked who they were, to which they replied that they were Muslims. A woman who had a son of hers with her was kindling a fire under her pot, and when the heat increased she moved him away. She then went to the Prophet and asked, “Are you God’s messenger?” On his replying that he was, she said, “You for whom I would give my father and mother as ransom, tell me if God is not the most merciful of those who are merciful.” He replied that He certainly is, and she asked, “Is God not more merciful to His servants than a mother to her child?” and when he assured her that He certainly is, she replied that a mother does not cast her child into the fire. God’s messenger then bowed his head and wept, and afterwards raised it, looked at her and said, “God punishes only those of His servants who act audaciously towards Him and refuse to say that there is no god but God.” 
Ibn Majah transmitted it.
Hadith - 2276
Thauban reported the Prophet as saying that a servant seeks to please God and keeps on doing so, then God who is great and glorious says to Gabriel, “My servant so and so seeks to please me, therefore my mercy had descended on him.” Gabriel says, “God’s mercy has descended on so and so,” and the bearers of the Throne and those who are around them say it until the inhabitants of the seven heavens say it, after which it comes down to him on the earth. 
Ahmad transmitted it.
Hadith - 2277
In connection with God’s words, “Among them are some who wrong themselves, some who follow a middle course, and some who are foremost in good deeds,”  Usama b. Zaid reported the Prophet as saying, “They will all go to paradise.”

Hadith - 2278
‘Abdallah told that when evening came God’s messenger would say, "We have come to the evening, and in the evening the dominion belongs to God; praise be to God; there is no god but God alone who has no partner; to Him belongs the dominion, to Him praise is due, and He is omnipotent. O God, I ask Thee for something of the good of this night and the good of what it contains, and I seek refuge in Thee from its evil and the evil of what it contains. O God, I seek refuge in Thee from indolence, decrepitude, the evil of old age, temptation in this world, and the punishment in the grave." In the morning he said that also: "We have come to the morning, and in the morning the dominion belongs to God ..." A version has, "My Lord, I seek refuge in Thee from a punishment in hell and a punishment in the grave." 
Muslim transmitted it.
Hadith - 2279
Hudhaifa said that when the Prophet lay down on his bed at night he placed his hand under his cheek, and would then say, "O God, in Thy name I die and live." When he awoke he said, "Praise be to God who has given us life after causing us to die,* and to whom we shall be resurrected." 
*Behind this phrase probably lies the idea expressed in Qur’an, xxxix, 42 which says, "It is God who takes the souls at the time of their death, and those which do not die during their sleep."
Bukhari transmitted it, Muslim transmitting from al-Bara’.
Hadith - 2280
Abu Huraira reported God’s messenger as saying that when any of them went to bed he should dust his bedding with the inner extremity of his lower garment, for he does not know what has come on to it since he left it. He should then say, “In Thy name, my Lord, I lay down my side and in Thee I raise it up. If Thou keepest my soul have mercy on it, but if Thou lettest it go guard it with that with which Thou guardest Thy upright servants.” A version says that he should then lie down on his right side and say, “In Thy name...” 
(Bukhari and Muslim). A version says he should dust it three times with the border of his garment, and has “If Thou keepest my soul grant it pardon.”
Hadith - 2281
Al-Bara’ b. ‘Azib said that when God’s messenger went to bed he lay on his right side and then said, “O God, I have handed over my soul to Thee, turned my face to Thee, entrusted my affairs to Thee, and committed my back to Thee out of desire for and fear of Thee. There is no refuge and no place of safety from Thee except by having recourse to Thee. I believe in Thy Book which Thou hast sent down and in Thy Prophet whom Thou hast sent.” God’s messenger said that if anyone repeated these words and died that night, he would die in the true religion. In a version he reported God’s messenger as telling a man to perform the ablution for prayer when he went to bed, lie down on his right side, and say, “O God, I have handed over my soul to Thee . . . Thou hast sent.” He added, “If you die during the night you will die in the true religion, and if you live till the morning you will obtain good.”
(Bukhari and Muslim.)
Hadith - 2282
Anas told that when God’s messenger went to his bed he said, “Praise be to God who has fed us, given us drink, satisfied us and given us refuge. Many there are who have no one to provide sufficiency for them, or give them refuge.” 
Muslim transmitted it.
Hadith - 2283
‘Ali said that Fatima went to the Prophet to complain of the effect of the grinding-stone on her hand, as she had heard that he had acquired some slaves, but did not find him, so she mentioned the matter to ‘A'isha. When he came ‘A'isha informed him. ‘Ali said: He visited us when we had gone to bed, and when we were about to get up he told us to stay where we were. He then came and sat down between her and me, and I felt the coldness of his foot on my belly. He then said, “Let me guide you to something better than what you have asked. When you go to bed, say ‘Glory be to God’ thirty-three times, ‘Praise be to God’ thirty-three times, and ‘God is most great’ thirty-four times. That will be better for you than a servant.” 
(Bukhari and Muslim.)
Hadith - 2284

*The Arabic word may be read either as shirk (attributing a partner to God), or as sharah
(snare). The former is preferred. Cf. Mirqat, ili, 99.
Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud and Darimi transmitted it.
Hadith - 2287
Aban b. ‘Uthman said he heard his father quoting God’s messenger as saying that if anyone says three times every morning and evening, “In the name of God, when whose name is mentioned nothing in earth or heaven can cause harm, and He is the Hearer, the Knower,” he will not be harmed by anything. Aban was afflicted by some paralysis, and when a man began to look at him Aban would say, “Why are you looking at me? The tradition is as I told it to you, but I did not say the words that day in order that God might carry out what He had decreed for me.” 
Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Abu Dawud transmitted it. Abu Dawud’s version has, “He will not suffer sudden affliction till the morning, and if anyone says it in the morning he will not suffer sudden affliction till the evening.”
Hadith - 2288
‘Abdallah  said that the Prophet used to say in the evening, “We have come to the evening, and in the evening the dominion belongs to God; praise be to God; there is no god but God alone who has no partner; to Him belongs the dominion, to Him praise is due, and He is omnipotent. My Lord, I ask Thee for the good of what this night contains and the good of what comes after it; I seek refuge in Thee from the evil of what this night contains and the evil of what comes after it; my Lord, I seek refuge in Thee from indolence and from the evil of old age, or infidelity."* A version has, "From the evil of old age and pride. My Lord, I seek refuge in Thee from a punishment in hell and a punishment in the grave." In the morning he said that also: "We have come to the morning, and in the morning the dominion belongs to God..."
*The transmitter was not sure which word was used.

Abu Dawud transmitted it.
Hadith - 2291
Abu ‘Ayyash reported God's messenger as saying that if anyone says in the morning, “There is no god but God alone who has no partner; to Him belongs the dominion, to Him praise is due, and He is omnipotent,” he will have a reward equivalent to that for setting free a slave from among the descendants of Ishmael, will have ten good deeds recorded for him, will have ten evil deeds deducted from him, will be advanced ten degrees, and will be guarded from the devil till the evening. If he says them in the evening he will have a similar recompense till the morning. Hammad b. Salama said that a man saw God’s messenger in a dream and said, “Messenger of God, Abu ‘Ayyash is relating such and such on your authority,” to which he received the reply, “Abu ‘Ayyash has spoken the truth.” 
Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah transmitted it.
Hadith - 2292
Al-Harith b. Muslim at-Tamimi quoted his father as saying that God’s messenger told him secretly to say seven times when he had finished the sunset prayer, before speaking to anyone, “O God, protect me from hell”; for if he said that and died that night, exemption from it would be recorded for him.

Abu Dawud transmitted it.
Hadith - 2293

Tirmidhi and Abu Dawud transmitted it, Tirmidhi saying this is a gharib tradition.
Hadith - 2295

Glory and praise be unto Thee." 
Abu Dawud transmitted it.
Hadith - 2299
Abu Sa'id reported God's messenger as saying that if anyone says three times when going to bed, "I ask the forgiveness of God than whom there is no god, the Living, the Eternal, and I turn in repentance to Him," God will forgive him his sins, even if they are like the foam of the sea, or in number like the sand which is accumulated,* or as many as the leaves of the trees, or as numerous as the days of this world.
*The word is ‘alij. Some say ‘Alij is a place in the desert, the translation being ‘the sand of ‘Alij; others treat it as translated above.
Tirmidhi transmitted it, saying this is a gharib tradition.
Hadith - 2300
Shaddad b. Aus reported God’s messenger as saying, "If any Muslim recites a sura from God’s Book when he goes to bed, God will put an angel in charge of him, and nothing which may harm him will come near him till he wakes". 
Tirmidhi transmitted it.
Hadith - 2301
‘Abdallah b. ‘Amr b. al-‘As reported God’s messenger as saying there are two characteristics which will not be retained by any Muslim without his entering paradise. While they are easy, those who act upon them are few. One should say ‘Glory be to God’ ten times after every prayer, ‘Praise be to God’ ten times and ‘God is most great’ ten times. (He said he had seen God’s messenger counting them on his hand, and saying, “That is a hundred and fifty on the tongue, but one thousand five hundred in the scale”). When he goes to his bed he should say ‘Glory be to God,’ ‘God is most Great’ and ‘Praise be to God’ a hundred times, for that is a hundred on the tongue, but a thousand in the scale. He asked them which of them could commit two thousand five hundred sins in a day and a night.* He was asked how they could not retain these characteristics, and told them that the devil comes to a man while he is engaged in prayer, calling such and such and such and such to his memory until he turns away and perhaps may not do it. He also comes to him on his bed and keeps on making him sleep till he falls asleep.
*The thousand plus the preceding fifteen hundred make two thousand five hundred good deeds with which the man who observes the two characteristics mentioned is credited, and as one could hardly commit as many sins in a day and a night there is a balance in his favour.
Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud and Nasa’i transmitted it. In Abu Dawud's version he said, “Two qualities or two characteristics will not be adhered to by a Muslim ...” And also in his version after saying “One thousand five hundred in the scale” he said, “When he goes to his bed he should say ‘God is most great’ thirty-four times, ‘Praise be to God’ thirty-three times and ‘Glory be to God’ thirty-three times.” In most texts of al-Masabih it is given on the authority of ‘Abdallah b. ‘Umar.
Hadith - 2302
‘Abdallah b. Ghannam reported God’s messenger as saying, that if anyone says in the morning, "O God, whatever favour has come to me or to any of Thy creatures in the morning, it comes from Thee alone who hast no partner, to whom be praise and thanksgiving," he will have expressed full thanksgiving for the day; and if anyone says the same in the evening he will have expressed full thanksgiving for the night.
Abu Dawud transmitted it.
Hadith - 2303
Abu Huraira told that when the Prophet went to his bed he used to say, “O God, Lord of the heavens, Lord of the earth, Lord of everything, who splittest the grain and the kernel, who hast sent down the Torah, the Injil and the Qur’an, I seek refuge in Thee from the evil of every evil agent whose forelock Thou seizest. Thou art the First and there is nothing before Thee; Thou art the Last and there is nothing after Thee; Thou art the Outward and there is nothing above Thee; Thou art the Inward and there is nothing below Thee. Pay the debt for me and grant me riches instead of poverty.” 
Abu Dawud, Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah transmitted it. Muslim also transmitted it with a slight difference.
Hadith - 2304
Abul Azhar al-Aimari told that when God’s messenger went to his bed at night he said, “In the name of God. I have laid down my side for God. O God, forgive me my sin, drive away my devil, free me from my responsibility, and place me in the highest assembly.”

Abu Dawud transmitted it.
Hadith - 2306
Buraida said that Khalid b. al-Walid complained to God’s messenger that he was afflicted by sleeplessness at night, and God’s Prophet told him to say when he went to his bed, “O God, Lord of the seven heavens and what they overshadow, Lord of the earths and what they carry, Lord of the devils and what they lead astray, be a Protector to me from the evil of Thy entire creation lest any of them do evil or act wrongfully to me. Strong is Thy protection and glorious is Thy praise. There is no god other than Thee. There is no god but Thee.”

Hadith - 2307
Abu Malik reported God’s messenger as saying that when one got up in the morning he should say, "We have reached the morning, and in the morning the dominion belongs to God, the Lord of the universe, O God, I ask Thee for the good this day contains, for conquest, victory, light, blessing and guidance during it; and I seek refuge in Thee from the evil it contains and the evil contained in what comes after it."

Nawawi mentioned it in Kitab al-adhkar by the transmission of Ibn as-Sunni.
Hadith - 2310

Abza told that God's messenger used to say in the morning, “We have reached the morning following the original religion of Islam, the assertion of God’s unity, the religion of our Prophet Muhammad, and the rite of our father Abraham who was a hanif and was not one of the polytheists."  
Ahmad and Darimi transmitted it.
Hadith - 2311
Ibn ‘Abbas reported God’s messenger as saying that if anyone who means to have intercourse with his wife says, “In the name of God.

Sulaiman b. Surad said: Two men reviled one another in the Prophet’s presence when we were sitting near him, and when one of them who had become red in the face reviled the other angrily the Prophet said that he knew a phrase by repeating which the man could get rid of his angry feelings: “I seek refuge in God from that accursed devil.” Those present asked the man whether he heard what the Prophet was saying, and he replied, “I am not possessed by a devil.”*
*Majnun. The word literally means to be possessed by a jinni, but it can also mean to be possessed by a devil. Shaitan is used in the preceding sentence. Majnun is also used meaning ‘mad’, but that does not fit this context.
(Bukhari and Muslim.)

Hadith - 2315
Ibn ‘Umar said that when God’s messenger sat on his camel to go out on a journey, he said “God is most great” three times. Then he said, "Glory be to Him who has made this subservient to us, for we had not the strength for it, and to our Lord do we return. O God, we ask Thee in this journey of ours for uprightness, piety and such deeds as are pleasing to Thee. O God, make easy for us this journey of ours and make its length short for us. O God, Thou art the Companion in the journey and the One who looks after the family and the property in our absence. O God, I seek refuge in Thee from the difficulty of travelling, unhappiness in what I see, and finding harm has come when I return to my property and family." When he returned he said these words, adding, "Returning, repentant, serving and praising our Lord." 
Muslim transmitted it.

Muslim transmitted it.
Hadith - 2318
Abu Huraira told of a man coming to God’s messenger and saying, “Messenger of God, what I have suffered from a scorpion which stung me last night!” He replied that if he had said in the evening, "I seek refuge in God’s perfect words from the evil of what He has created," it would not have harmed him.

(Bukhari and Muslim.)
Hadith - 2322
‘Abdallah b. Busr said that God’s messenger visited his father and they presented him with some food and a mixture of dates, dried curd and clarified butter,* some of which he ate. Then some dates were brought to him and he ate them, throwing away the stones between two fingers, joining the forefinger and the middle finger. A version says that he began to throw away the stones on the outside of his forefinger and middle finger. He was then brought something to drink, and when he had drunk it  father took hold of the bridle of his beast and said, “Supplicate God for us.” So he said, “O God, bless them in that with which Thou hast provided them, forgive them and show them mercy.”

Tirmidhi transmitted it, and Ibn Majah transmitted it from Ibn ‘Umar. Tirmidhi said this is a gharib tradition, and ‘Amr b. Dinar, the transmitter, is not strong.

‘Umar reported God’s messenger as saying that if anyone says on entering the market, “There is no god but God alone who has no partner, to whom belongs the dominion, to whom praise is due, who gives life and causes death while He is living and does not die, in whose hand is good, and who is omnipotent,” God will record for him a million good deeds, obliterate from him a million evil deeds, raise him a million degrees, and build him a house in paradise. 
Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah transmitted it, Tirmidhi saying this is a gharib tradition. Sharh as-sunna has, “Says in a general market in which things are sold,” instead of “on entering the market.”
Hadith - 2326
Mu'adh b. Jabal said the Prophet heard a man making supplication saying, “O God, I ask Thee for complete favour,” and asked him what complete favour meant.

I have wronged myself, so forgive me, for only Thou forgivest sins.” He then laughed, and when he was asked what he was laughing at, he replied that he had seen God’s messenger do as he had done and laugh after that. He had asked him what he was laughing at, and he told him that his Lord was pleased with His servant when he asked Him to forgive him his sins, for God says, “He knows that I alone forgive sins.”

Tirmidhi transmitted it, saying this is a hasan gharib tradition.
Hadith - 2332
Abu Huraira told of a man who said, “Messenger of God, I intend to make a journey, so give me an injunction.” He told him to maintain fear of God and say “God is most great” on every rising ground, and when the man turned away he said, “O God, make the distance short for him and make the journey easy for him.” 
Tirmidhi transmitted it.
Hadith - 2333
Ibn ‘Umar said that when God’s messenger was travelling and night came on he said, "O earth, my Lord and your Lord is God; I seek refuge in God from your evil, the evil of what you contain, the evil of what has been created in you, and the evil of what creeps upon you; I seek refuge in God from lions, from large black snakes, from other snakes, from scorpions, from the evil of jinn  which inhabit a settlement and from a parent and his offspring."* 
*This last phrase occurs in Qur’an, xc, 3 where it appears to be used in a straightforward sense; but in the tradition it is said to be a reference to lblis and his offspring of devils.
Abu Dawud transmitted it.
Hadith - 2334

Ahmad, Tirmidhi and Nasa'i transmitted it, Tirmidhi saying this is a hasan sahih tradition, In the version of Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah, Umm Salama said that God’s messenger never went out of her house without raising his eye to the sky and saying, “O God, I seek refuge in Thee lest I stray or lead others stray,* or cause injustice, or suffer injustice, or do wrong, or have wrong done to me.”
*Some read as above, but others read 'or be led astray'.
Hadith - 2337

Abu Dawud transmitted it, and Tirmidhi transmitted up to “the devil will go far from him."
Hadith - 2338

Hadith - 2339
Abu Huraira said that when the Prophet congratulated* a man on his marriage he said, “God bless you, bless you both, and prosper your union.” 
*The verb used is raffa'a which originally meant saying to someone who had just been married, "may the marriage produce close union and sons." It is said that because this was a phrase used in pre-lslamic times, the Prophet substituted for it the words used in this tradition. The verb thus develops simply the meaning of congratulating without in itself involving any particular formula.
Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah transmitted it.
Hadith - 2340
'Amr b. Shu'aib, on his father’s authority, said his grandfather told how the Prophet said that when anyone of them married a woman, or bought a servant he should say, “O God, I ask Thee for the good in her and in the disposition Thou hast given her, and I seek refuge in Thee from the evil in her and in the disposition Thou hast given her.” When he buys a camel he should take hold of the top of its hump and say the same kind of thing. In a version regarding a woman and a servant it says he should take hold of her forelock and make supplication for a blessing. 
Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah transmitted it.
Hadith - 2341

Abu Dawud transmitted it.
Hadith - 2343
‘Ali told of a slave who had made a contract with his master to pay for his freedom(1) coming to him and saying, “I am unable to fulfill my contract,* so give me help.” He suggested teaching him words he had been taught by God’s messenger, which would be so effective that if he had a debt as large as a huge mountain God would pay it for him, telling him to say, “O God, grant me enough of what Thou makest lawful so that I may dispense with what Thou makest unlawful, and make me able by Thy grace to dispense with all but Thee.” 
1. Mukatab. Although the term comes from the root meaning to write, the contract was not necessarily written.

Tirmidhi and Baihaqi, in  ad-Da'awat al-kabir, transmitted it.
Hadith - 2344
‘A'isha said that when God’s messenger sat in an assembly or prayed he spoke some words, so she asked him about them. Saying that they were, “Glory be to Thee, O God, and I begin with praise of Thee; there is no god but Thou; I ask forgiveness of Thee and turn to Thee in repentance,” he told her that if one speaks what is good this will act as a seal on his words till the day of resurrection, and that if one speaks what is evil this will act as an atonement for what he has said.

Hadith - 2346
Ibn Mas'ud reported God’s messenger as saying that if anyone is afflicted by much care he should say, “O God, I am Thy servant, the son of Thy servant, the son of Thy handmaid, and at Thy disposal; my forelock is in Thy hand; Thy judgment is effective regarding me; just concerning me is Thy decree; I ask Thee by every name Thou hast by which Thou hast called Thyself, or sent down in Thy Book, or taught any of Thy creatures, or kept to Thyself in the hidden place of the unseen, to make the Qur’an the Spring of my heart and the means of clearing away my care and grief.” He declared that no one had ever said it without God removing his grief and giving him joy instead of it.

*Literally, ‘For the hearts had reached the windpipes.’
1. The word is 'aurat used in a similar prayer on p. 510. There it was translated 'faults'. Another meaning refers to places on a frontier, etc., which give openings to an enemy, and so are places where caution is necessary. This seems more suitable in the present context. Cf. Mirqat, iii, 134.

The man asked him to make supplication.  said: He then commanded him to perform ablution, doing it well, and make this supplication, “O God, I make request of Thee and I turn towards Thee by means of Thy prophet Muhammad, the prophet of mercy. By means of you 1 have turned towards my Lord to accomplish for me this need of mine. O God, make him an intercessor for me.”
1. bika. This would seem here to refer to the Prophet, although by itself it might naturally be taken to refer to God. The sentence which precedes certainly suggests that it must refer to the Prophet, in which case the translation might go, “by means of whom I have turned towards my Lord.” Changes of pronouns in Arabic often present difficulties to the translator.
Tirmidhi transmitted it, saying this is a hasan sahih gharib tradition.

Abud Darda’ reported God's messenger as saying that part of David's supplication was that he would say, “O God, I ask Thee for Thy love, 2 the love of those who love Thee, and deeds which will cause me to attain to Thy love. O God, make Thy love dearer to me than myself, my property, my family, and than cold water." He said that when God’s messenger mentioned David and talked about him, he would say that he was most devoted of men to worship.

Hadith - 2390
‘Ata’ b. as-Sa’ib told that his father said: ‘Ammar b. Yasir led us in a prayer and did so in brief form. One of the people camplained that he had shortened the prayer and conducted it briefly, but he replied that that would cause him no harm, for he had used in it various supplica­ tions he had heard from God’s messenger." When he got up to depart one of the people followed him (‘Ata’ explaining that this was his father although he made a vague reference to himself) 3 and asked him about the supplication, whereupon he came and informed the people of it as follows: “O God, by Thy knowledge of the unseen and Thy power to create, grant me life as long as Thou knowest life to be best for me, and take me when Thou knowest death to be best for me; O God, I ask Thee for fear of Thee both within my secret heart and openly; I ask Thee for the word of truth in pleasure and anger; I ask Thee for moderation both in poverty and riches; I ask Thee for felicity which does not pass away; I ask Thee for comfort which is not cut off; I ask Thee for satisfaction with what is decreed; I ask Thee for a pleasant life 1 after death; I ask Thee for the pleasure of looking at Thy face, and longing to meet Thee in a state in which distress does not cause harm or testing lead astray. O God, beautify us with the adornment of faith, and make us guides who are rightly guided.” 
Nasa’i transmitted it.
3. The vague reference consists in his saying "one of the people."
1. Literally "coolness of life." The word bard (coolness) develops the meaning of pleasantness.

Anas told of God’s messenger visiting a Muslim who had become as weak as a chicken and asking him whether he had been accustomed to make any supplication to God or ask Him for anything. On his replying that he had, for he was accustomed to say, "O God, what Thou meanest to punish me with in the next world inflict on me beforehand in this world," God’s messenger said, “Glory be to God! You are not capable of it or able to endure it.” He then asked why he had not said, "O God bring us blessing in this world, blessing in the next, and guard us from the punishment of hell."  said: The man used it in supplication to God, and God healed him.

Tirmidhi transmitted it.
