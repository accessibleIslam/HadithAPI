Hadith - 3626
Abu Huraira reported God’s Messenger as saying, “If anyone believes in God and His Messenger, observes the prayer and fasts during Ramadan, God will assuredly bring him into paradise whether he has engaged in jihad in God’s path or remained in his land in which he was born.” On being asked whether people should not be given this good news he replied, “In paradise there are a hundred degrees which God has prepared for those who engage in jihad in God’s path, between each pair of which there is a distance like that between heaven and earth; so when you make requests of God ask him for Firdaus, for it is the best and highest part of paradise, above it is the throne of the Compassionate One, and from it the rivers of paradise issue.” 
Bukhari transmitted it.
Hadith - 3627
He reported God’s Messenger as saying, “He who engages in jihad in God’s path is like him who fasts and spends the night in prayer, who assiduously recites God’s verses and does not slacken from fasting and prayer until he who is engaged in jihad in God’s path returns.” 
(Bukhari and Muslim.)
Hadith - 3628
He reported God’s Messenger as saying, “God answers the prayer for forgiveness of him who goes out in His path, being led to do so by nothing but faith in Him and belief in His Messengers, promising to bring him back with the reward or booty he obtains, or bring him into paradise.” 
(Bukhari and Muslim.)
Hadith - 3629
He reported God’s Messenger as saying, “By Him in whose hand my soul is, were it not that men among the believers are not satisfied with remaining behind me when I cannot get mounts for them, I would not stay behind when an expedition goes out in God’s path. By Him in whose hand my soul is, I wish I could be killed in God’s path and brought to life, then be killed and brought to life, then be killed and brought to life, then be killed.” 
(Bukhari and Muslim.)

(Bukhari and Muslim.)
Hadith - 3631
Anas reported God’s Messenger as saying, “A morning or an evening expedition in God’s path is better than the world and what it contains.” 
(Bukhari and Muslim.)
Hadith - 3632
Salman al-Fairisi told that he heard God’s Messenger say, “Being stationed for a day and a night on the frontier in God’s path is better than fasting a month and spending its nights in prayer. If one dies he will be rewarded for the deeds he was doing, he will be given his provision, and will be safe from him who tests him.”* 
* Al-fattan. There is some doubt as to the reference here. It may be the devil, this name being used because he tempts people to sin; or it may mean the one who examines men in the grave. Munkar and Nakir are called fattana'l-qabr, the two who test men in the grave.
Muslim transmitted it.
Hadith - 3633
Abu ‘Abs reported God’s Messenger as saying, “No man whose feet become dusty in God’s path will be touched by hell.” 
Bukhari transmitted it.
Hadith - 3634
Abu Huraira reported God's Messenger as saying, “An infidel and the one who killed him will never be brought together in hell.”* 
* The meaning is probably that one who kills an infidel in the course of jihad will on that account have his sins forgiven, and will therefore not go to hell where the infidel inevitably goes.
Muslim transmitted it.
Hadith - 3635
He reported God’s Messenger as saying, “One of the best types of subsistence is that of a man who grasps his horse’s rein in (God’s path and races on its back, making for the places where being killed and dying are liable to take place as often as he hears a terrible shout or a cry for help; or of a man with a few sheep on one of these highlands or down in one of these wadis who observes prayer, pays the zakat and worships his Lord till death* comes. Such a one is in a good condition among men.” 
* Al-yaqin, the certainty.
Muslim transmitted it.
Hadith - 3636
Zaid b. Khalid reported God’s Messenger as saying, “He who equips a fighter in God’s path has taken part in the fighting, and he who looks after a fighter's family when he is away has taken part in the fighting." 
(Bukhari and Muslim.)
Hadith - 3637
Buraida reported God's Messenger as saying, “The respect to be shown by those who stay at home to the women of those who are engaged in jihad is to be like that shown to their mothers. If any man among those who stay at home is entrusted with the oversight of his family by one who is engaged in jihad and betrays him, he will be set up for him* on the day of resurrection and he may take what he wants from his good deeds. So what do you think?” 
*i.e. the betrayer for the man he has betrayed.
Muslim transmitted it.
Hadith - 3638
Abu Mas'ud al-Ansari told that a man brought a she-camel with a rope through its nose-ring and said, “This is to be devoted to God’s path." God’s Messenger replied to him, “On the day of resurrection you will get for it seven hundred she-camels each with a rope through its nose-ring.” 
Muslim transmitted it.
Hadith - 3639

Muslim transmitted it.
Hadith - 3641
Abu Huraira reported God’s Messenger as saying, “No one is wounded in God's path, and God knows best those who are wounded in His path, without coming on the day of resurrection with his wound spouting blood, the colour being that of blood but the fragrance that of musk.” 
(Bukhari and Muslim.)
Hadith - 3642
Anas reported God’s Messenger as saying, “No one who enters paradise will want to return to the world and have anything in the earth except the martyr. He will wish to return to the world and be killed ten times because of the honour he sees.” 
(Bukhari and Muslim.)
Hadith - 3643
Masruq said: We asked 'Abdallah b. Mas'ud about this verse, “Do not consider those who have been killed in God’s path to be dead; nay, they are alive in the presence of their Lord and are being supplied with provision" (Al-Qur’an; 3:169). He replied that he had asked about that, and the Prophet said, "Their spirits are in the crops of green birds which have lamps suspended from the Throne, which go where they wish in paradise and then return to those lamps. Their Lord looks down on them and asks whether they desire anything, and they ask in reply what they could wish when they can go where they like in paradise. He does that with them three times, and when they see that they will not be left alone without asking something, they tell their Lord that they wish Him to return their spirits to their bodies so that they may be killed in His path once again. Then when He sees that they lack nothing they are left without further questioning." 
Muslim transmitted it.
Hadith - 3644
Abu Qatada told that God's Messenger got up among them and mentioned to them that jihad in God’s path and faith in God are the most excellent works. A man rose and asked, "Tell me, Messenger of God, if I am killed in God’s path will my sins be covered up?" He replied, "Yes, if you are killed in God's path while showing endurance, seeking your reward from God, advancing and not retreating." Then God’s Messenger said, "What did you say?”* He replied, "Tell me, if I am killed in God’s path will my sins be covered up?" God's Messenger said, "Yes, while you are showing endurance, seeking your reward from God, advancing and not retreating; but this does not include a debt, for Gabriel told me that." 
*Mirqat iv, 176 quotes Tibi to explain the request to repeat his question when a reply had already been given. The purpose is said to be to make the exception at the end of the second reply.
Muslim transmitted it.

‘Abdallah b. ‘Amr b. al-'As reported the Prophet as saying. "Being killed in God’s path will cover up everything but debt." 
Muslim transmitted it.
Hadith - 3646
Abu Huraira reported God's Messenger as saying, "God most high will cheerfully welcome two men one of whom kills the other. They will enter paradise, one having fought in God’s path and been killed, and the slayer, after receiving God's pardon, having died as a martyr."* 
* The man who had fought and killed a Muslim later became a Muslim himself and was killed in the course of jihad.
(Bukhari and Muslim.)

Anas told that ar-Rubaiyi‘ daughter of al-Bara’, who was the mother of Haritha b. Suraqa, came to the Prophet and said, “Prophet of God, will you not tell me about Haritha? (He had been killed at the battle of Badr, being struck by a random arrow.) If he is in paradise I shall show endurance, but if he has met another fate I shall exert myself in weeping for him.” He replied, “Mother of Haritha, in paradise there are gardens, and your son has attained to al-Firdaus, the highest.” 
Bukhari transmitted it.
Hadith - 3649
He told that God’s Messenger and his companions went off and reached Badr before the polytheists, and when the polytheists arrived he said, “Rise to go to a garden whose breadth is as great as the heavens and the earth.” ‘Umair b. al-Humam thereupon said, “Bravo, bravo!” and when God’s Messenger asked him what had made him say that, he replied, “Nothing, I swear by God, Messenger of God, but a hope that I might be among its inhabitants.” He told him that he would be among them. He then took some dates out of his quiver and began to eat them, but after a little said, “If I live till I eat my dates it will mean a long life.” So he threw away the dates he had and then fought with the enemy till he was killed. 
Muslim transmitted it.
Hadith - 3650
'Abu Huraira reported God’s Messenger as saying, “Whom do you reckon to be the martyr among you?” His hearers replied, “The one who is killed in God’s path is the martyr, Messenger of God.” He said, “The martyrs among my people would then be few. He who is killed in God’s path is a martyr, he who dies in God’s path is a martyr, he who dies of plague is a martyr, and he who dies of a disease in the belly is a martyr.” 
Muslim transmitted it.
Hadith - 3651
‘Abdallah b. ‘Amr reported God’s Messenger as saying, “No war-like party or body of troops will go out to fight, gain booty and return safe without getting beforehand two-thirds of their rewards,* and no war-like party or body of troops will be disappointed of their hopes and be smitten without getting their rewards in full.” 
* The suggestion is made that the two-thirds are a safe return and booty which they get in this world, the remaining third being reward in the next.
Muslim transmitted it.
Hadith - 3652
Abu Huraira reported God’s Messenger as saying, “He who dies without having fought, or having felt it to be his duty will die guilty of a kind of hypocrisy.” 
Muslim transmitted it.
Hadith - 3653
Abu Musa told that a man came to the Prophet and said, “One man fights for booty, one for the reputation of fighting, and one for his degree  to be seen; which of them is in God’s path?” He replied, “The one who fights that God’s word may have preeminence is in God’s path.” 
(Bukhari and Muslim.)
Hadith - 3654
Anas told that when God’s Messenger returned from the expedition to Tabuk and approached Medina he said, “In Medina there are people who did not fail to be with you wherever you went and whatever wadi you crossed.” A version has, “Who have not failed to share your reward.” On their expressing surprise that that should be true when they were still in Medina, he said, “While they are still in Medina, being kept back by a valid excuse.” 
Bukhari transmitted it, and Muslim transmitted it on Jabir’s authority.
Hadith - 3655
‘Abdallah b. ‘Amr told that a man came to God’s Messenger and asked his permission to take part in jihad. He asked him if his parents were still alive, and when he replied that they were, he told him to exert himself* on their behalf. 
*The point is not so clear in English as in Arabic. Jihad, while being the word for fighting against infidels, also means to strive or to exert oneself in general. The man wished to take part in jihad, and when the Prophet heard that his parents were still alive he said fa-fihima fa-jahid (exert yourself on their behalf.)
(Bukhari and Muslim.) A version has, “Return to your parents and look after them well.”
Hadith - 3656
Ibn ‘Abbas reported the Prophet as saying on the day of the Conquest of Mecca, “There is no emigration after the Conquest, but only jihad and some good intention; so when you are summoned to fight, go forth.”

Abu Dawud transmitted it.
Hadith - 3659

Tirmidhi transmitted it, saying this is a gharib tradition.
Hadith - 3661
Fadala b. ‘Ubaid reported God’s Messenger as saying, “Everyone who dies will have fully completed his actions, except one who is on the frontier in God’s path, for his deeds will be made to go on increasing for him till the day of resurrection, and he will be safe from the trial in the grave." 
Tirmidhi and Abu Dawud transmitted it, and Darimi transmitted it on the authority of ‘Uqba b. ‘Amir.
Hadith - 3662
Mu'adh b. Jabal told of his hearing God’s Messenger say, “If anyone fights in God’s path as long as the time between two milkings of a she- camel* paradise will be assured for him; if anyone is wounded in God’s path or suffers a misfortune, it will come on the day of resurrection as copious as possible, its colour saffron and its odour musk; and if anyone suffers from ulcers while in God's path, he will have on him the stamp of the martyrs."
* This refers particularly to the practice of milking a camel, then leaving it for a little to suckle its young, after which it is milked again. The period between the two milkings therefore indicates a very short time.
Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud and Nasa’i transmitted it.
Hadith - 3663

Tirmidhi transmitted it.
Hadith - 3665
Abu Huraira reported God’s Messenger as saying, “No one who weeps from fear of God will go into hell till the milk returns to the udder, and no servant of God will experience both dust in God’s path and the smoke of jahannam."
 
Tirmidhi transmitted it, and Nasa'i added in another version, “ever in a Muslim’s nostrils." In another by him he added, “ever in the belly of a servant of God; and stinginess and faith will never be combined in the heart of a servant of God."
Hadith - 3666

Hadith - 3667
Abu Huraira told that when one of God’s Messenger’s companion came upon a mountain path containing a small spring of fresh water and was delighted by it, he expressed a desire to withdraw from the people and stay in that path. He mentioned that to God’s Messenger, and he replied, “Do not do it, for when any of you remains in God’s path it is more excellent than prayer in his house during seventy years. Do you not want* God to forgive you and bring you into paradise? Fight* in God's path. He who fights in God's path as long as the time between two milkings of a she-camel will be assured of paradise." 
*These verbs are in plural.

Tirmidhi transmitted it.
Hadith - 3670
‘Abdallah b. Hubshi told that the Prophet was asked which deed was most excellent and replied, “Standing long in prayer." He was asked what sadaqa was most excellent and replied, “The effort of one who possesses little.” He was asked what hijra was most excellent and replied, “That of one who forsakes what God has prohibited.” He was asked what jihad was most excellent and replied, “That of one who strives against the polytheists with his property and his person.” He was asked what manner of being killed was most honourable and replied, “That of one whose blood is shed and whose steed is wounded.” 
Abu Dawud transmitted it Nasa’i’s version says that the Prophet was asked which actions were most excellent and replied, “Faith which contains no doubt, jihad which contains no unfaithfulness regarding spoil, and a pilgrimage which is accepted.” He was asked what prayer was most excellent and replied, “Standing long in devotion.” The two versions agree about the remainder.
Hadith - 3671
Al-Miqdam b. Ma'dikarib reported God’s Messenger as saying, “The martyr receives six1 good things from God: he is forgiven at the first shedding of his blood, he is shown his abode in paradise, he is preserved from the punishment in the grave, he is kept safe from the greatest terror2, he has placed on his head the crown of honour a ruby of which is better than the world and what it contains, he is married to seventy-two wives of the maidens with large dark eyes,3 and is made intercessor for seventy of his relatives.”

Tirmidhi, Nasa’i and Darimi transmitted it, Tirmidhi saying this is a hasan gharib tradition.
Hadith - 3674
Abu Umama reported the Prophet as saying, “Nothing is dearer to God than two drops and two marks, a drop of tears from fear of God and a drop of blood shed in God’s path. Regarding the two marks, they are a mark received in God’s path and one caused by observing one of the ordinances of God most high.”* 
* This is said to refer to such things as hacks in hands or feet through performing ablution in cold weather, or a mark on the forehead through prostrating oneself on hot ground, or having dust on one’s feet while performing pilgrimage.
Tirmidhi transmitted it, saying this is a hasan gharib tradition.
Hadith - 3675
‘Abdallah b. ‘Amr reported God’s Messenger as saying, “Do not sail on the sea except when going to perform the hajj, or the ‘umra, or when fighting in God’s path, for under the sea there is a fire and under the fire there is a sea.”

Abu Dawud transmitted it.
Hadith - 3678
‘Abdallah b. ‘Amr reported God’s Messenger as saying, “Returning home is like going on an expedition.”*

He reported God's Messenger as saying, “The fighter gets his reward, and the one who equips him gets his own reward and that of the fighter.” 
Abu Dawud transmitted it.

A man will be unwilling to join a company, so he will escape from his people and go round the tribes offering himself to them, seeking someone whose place he may take in such and such an expedition.* That man is a hireling to the last drop of his blood.” 
* This is the type of person who dislikes being sent on a warlike expedition, but who is quite willing to take someone else’s place if he is paid for it.
Abu Dawud transmitted it.
Hadith - 3681
Ya‘la. b. Umayya said: God’s Messenger announced an expedition, and as I was a very old man who had no servant I sought a hireling who would serve instead of me. I found a man to whom I offered three dinars, and when some booty arrived I wanted to give him his portion, so I went to the Prophet and mentioned the matter to him, but he said, “All I can find for him regarding this expedition of his in this world and the next is the three dinars which were offered him." 
Abu Dawud transmitted it.

Abu Dawud transmitted it.
Hadith - 3683
Mu'adh reported God’s Messenger as saying, “Fighting is of two kinds. The one who seeks God’s favour, obeys the leader, gives property he values, helps his associate and avoids doing mischief will have a reward for all the time he is asleep and awake, but the one who fights in a boasting spirit, for the sake of display and to gain a reputation, who disobeys the leader and does mischief in the earth will not return without credit or blame.’’*
* i.e. the wrong he has done exceeds the good.
Malik, Abu Dawud and Nasa’i transmitted it.
Hadith - 3684
'Abdallah b. ‘Amr told that he asked God’s Messenger to tell him about jihad and he replied, “If you fight with endurance, ‘Abdallah b. ‘Amr, seeking from God your reward, God will resurrect you showing endurance and seeking your reward from Him, but if you fight for vain show seeking to acquire much God will resurrect you making a vain show and seeking to acquire much. In whatever state you fight or are killed, ‘Abdallah b. ‘Amr, in that state God will resurrect you." 
Abu Dawud transmitted it.

Abu Dawud transmitted it.
Hadith - 3686
Abu Umama said: We went out with God’s Messenger on an expedition and when a man came upon a cave containing some water and vegetables he felt inclined to stay in it and withdraw from the world, so he asked God’s Messenger’s permission regarding that, but he replied, “I was not commissioned with Judaism, or Christianity, but with the easy Hanif religion. By Him in whose hand Muhammad's soul is, a morning or an evening expedition in God’s path is better than the world and what it contains, and for one of you to remain in the line of battle is better than his prayers for sixty years.” 
Ahmad transmitted it.
Hadith - 3687
‘Ubada b. as-Samit reported God’s Messenger as saying, “He who fights in God’s path with no intention but getting a tethering rope will have what he intended.”* 
* This saying advocates the necessity of having proper motives. If all one wants is some material gain that is all he will get, for he will not deserve any eternal reward.
Nasa’i transmitted it.
Hadith - 3688
Abu Sa'id reported God’s Messenger as saying, “If anyone is pleased with God as Lord, with Islam as religion and with Muhammad as Messenger, paradise will be assured to him.” Abu Sa'id was delighted with this and asked him to repeat it. He did so and then said, “There is also something else for which God will raise a servant in paradise a hundred degrees between each two of which there is a distance like that between heaven and earth.” He asked God's Messenger what it was and he replied, “jihad in God's path; jihad in God’s path; jihad in God’s path.” 
Muslim transmitted it.
Hadith - 3689
Abu Musa reported God’s Messenger as saying, “The gates of paradise are under the shadow of the swords.” A man with a ragged appearance got up and asked Abu Musa whether he had heard God's Messenger say that; and when he received the reply that he had, he returned to his companions, said, “I salute you,” then broke the scabbard of his sword and threw it away, then went towards the enemy with his sword and plied it till he was killed. 
Muslim transmitted it.
Hadith - 3690
Ibn ‘Abbas reported God’s Messenger as saying to his companions, “When your brethren were smitten at the battle of Uhud God put their spirits in the crops of green birds which go down to the rivers of paradise, eat its fruits and nestle in lamps of gold in the shade of the Throne. Then when they experienced the sweetness of their food, drink and rest they asked who would tell their brethren about them that they were alive in paradise in order that they might not cease to desire paradise or recoil in war. God most high said He would tell them about them, so He sent down, ‘And do not consider those who have been killed in God’s path to be dead; nay, they are alive in the presence of their Lord and are being supplied with provision . ..” (Al-Qur’an; 3:169 ff.)
 
Abu Dawud transmitted it.
Hadith - 3691
Aba Sa'id al-Khudri reported God’s Messenger as saying, “The believers in the world are in three classes: those who believe in God and His Messenger and do not doubt, but strive with their property and their persons in God’s path; the man whom people trust with their property and their persons; then the man who, when he is about to display greed, abandons it for the sake of God who is great and glorious.” 
Ahmad transmitted it.
Hadith - 3692
‘Abd ar-Rahman b. Abu ‘Amira* reported God’s Messenger as saying, “No Muslim soul which God takes wants to return to you and have the world and what it contains except the martyr.” Ibn Abu ‘Amira told that God’s Messenger said, “That I should be slain in God’s path is dearer to me than to possess the nomads and the townsmen.” 
* On p. 725 the name appears as 'Abd ar-Rahman b. Abu ‘Amra al-Ansari. Ibn 'Abd al-Barr, Isti'ab, p 395 treats the two as one man, quoting al-Walid b. Muslim to the effect that he was ‘Abd ar-Rahman b. 'Amra or 'Amira al-Muzani, but in the heading of the section he gives the name as 'Abd ar-Rahman b. Abu 'Amira. He says he has been reputed to have been a companion of the Prophet, but that this is not correct. He was a Syrian.
Nasa’i transmitted it.
Hadith - 3693
Hasna’ daughter of Mu'awiya said her paternal uncle told her he had asked the Prophet who were in paradise, and he replied, “Prophets are in paradise, martyrs are in paradise, infants are in paradise, and children buried alive are in paradise.”

Ibn Majah transmitted it.
Hadith - 3695
Fadala b. ‘Ubaid told of hearing ‘Umar b. al-Khattab say he had heard God’s Messenger saying, "The martyrs are of four types: (1) a believing man whose faith is good who meets the enemy and is sincere towards God till he is killed, and that is the one to whom men will raise their eyes on the day of resurrection thus (raising his head till his cap fell off, but I do not know whether he meant ‘Umar’s cap or the Prophet’s cap); (2) a believing man whose faith is good, who meets the enemy and appears as if his skin had been torn by acacia thorns through cowardice, and then is killed by a random arrow, he being in the second class; (3) a believing man who mingles a good deed with another which is bad who meets the enemy and is sincere towards God till he is killed, that one being in the third class; (4) a believing man who has been dissipated who meets the enemy and is sincere towards God till he is killed, that one being in the fourth class.” 
Tirmidhi transmitted it, saying this is hasan gharib tradition.
Hadith - 3696
‘Utba b. ‘Abd as-Sulami reported God’s Messenger as saying, “The slain are of three types: (1) a believer who strives with his property and person in God’s path and when he meets the enemy fights till he is killed. (Of him the Prophet said that that martyr who has suffered trial is in God's tent under- His Throne and is not excelled by the prophets except in the degree of the prophetic office.) (2) A believer who mingles a good deed with another which is evil, who fights with his person and property in God’s path, fighting till he is killed when he meets the enemy. (Of him the Prophet said that it is a cleansing agent which has obliterated his sins and his errors, for the sword obliterates errors, and he will be introduced by whichever of the gates of paradise he wishes.) (3) A hypocrite who strives with his person and property, and when he meets the enemy fights till he is killed; but that one will go to hell, for the sword does not obliterate hypocrisy.” 
Darimi transmitted it.
Hadith - 3697
Ibn ‘A’idh told that God’s Messenger went out to a man’s funeral, and when he was laid down ‘Umar b. al-Khattab said, "Do not pray over him, Messenger of God, for he was a wicked man. Thereupon God’s Messenger turned to the people and asked whether any of them has seen him engaged in anything which indicated that he was a Muslim, and when a man replied, "Yes, Messenger of God, he acted as guard one night in God's path,” he prayed over him, scattered dust over him, and then said, "Your companions think you are one of those who go to hell, but I testify that you are one of those who go to paradise.” He then said, "You will not be questioned, ‘Umar, about what people have done, but you will be questioned about the true religion.”* 
* This is taken to mean that he will not be questioned about acts of disobedience, but about indication that one is a Muslim.
Baihaqi transmitted it in Shu'ab al-lman.
Hadith - 3698

He told that he heard God's Messenger say, “The Byzantines will be defeated at your hands and God will defend you, but let none of you be so careless as not to employ his arrows.”*

Hadith - 3701
Salama b. al-Akwa‘ told that God’s Messenger went out to some people of Aslam who were having a shooting match in the suq* and said, “Shoot, sons of Ishmael, for your ancestor was an archer. I am supporting the B. so and so,” referring to one of the two parties. They then stopped, and when he asked what was the matter, they replied, “How can we shoot when you are supporting the B. so and so?” He said, “Shoot; I am supporting you all.” 
* Different explanations are given. It may be in the market-place (suq). Mirqat, iv, 202 is inclined to understand suq as the plural of saq (leg) and interpret it as meaning that they were on their feet, not riding camels. It has even been said that the reading is as-Sauq and that this is the name of a place; but I can find no reference to any such place. This all goes to show how difficult interpreters can make a passage seem when they let their imagination loose.
Bukhari transmitted it.

Zuraiq, a distance of a mile. 
* Thaniya is a mountain pass. Thaniyat al-Wada' is a pass overlooking Medina by which people went on the road to Mecca.
(Bukhari and Muslim)
Hadith - 3708
Anas told that God’s Messenger had a she-camel called al-‘Adba' which had not been outstripped by any other, but a nomadic Arab came on a young riding camel of his and it outstripped it.

Hadith - 3709
‘Uqba b. ‘Amir told that he heard God’s Messenger say, "God most high will cause three persons to enter paradise for one arrow: the maker when he has a good motive in making it, the one who shoots it, and the one who hands it; so shoot and ride, but your shooting is more appreciated by me than your riding. Everything with which a man amuses himself is vain, except his shooting with his bow, his training of his horse, and his playing with his wife, for they pertain to what is right.”

Baihaqi transmitted it in Shu'ab al-iman. Abu Dawud transmitted the first section, Nasa’i the first and second, and Tirmidhi the second and third. The version of Nasa’i and Tirmidhi has, “If anyone develops a grey hair in God’s path,” instead of “on behalf of Islam."

* The camel was evidently tired, and the man seems to have been looking around to see whether he could get any help. Another suggestion is that the man was walking with his goods loaded on the camel, but the wording hardly supports this. Cf. Mirqat, iv, 213 f.
Muslim transmitted it.

Hadith - 3742
He told that when the Prophet came to Medina he slew a camel or a cow.* 
* There seems to be no certainty as to whether this refers to the arrival at the time of the Hijra, or whether the tradition means to indicate a general practice. It is said that the sunna requires one who returns from a journey to provide such entertainment as is within his means. If the use of "or” in the tradition does not indicate a doubt on the part of the transmitter as to which word is correct, but is a real alternative, this would justify the view that the tradition speaks of a practice of the Prophet. But the Arabic construction really suggests one occasion rather than any time the Prophet came back to Medina.
Bukhari transmitted it.

* i.e. the reward in the next world for walking part of the way.

Ibn ‘Abbas told that the Prophet wrote to Qaisar summoning him to Islam. He sent Dihya al-Kalbi with his letter to him and ordered him to hand it to the governor of Busra for him to convey to Qaisar. Its contents were: In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful. From Muhammad, God’s servant and Messenger, to Hiraql1 chief of the Byzantines. Peace be to those who follow the guidance. To proceed: I send you the summons to accept Islam (bi da'iyat al-islam). If you accept Islam you will be safe, and if you accept Islam God will bring you your reward twofold; but if you turn away you will be guilty of the sin of your followers (al-arisiyin).2 “0 people of the Book, come to a word which is common between us and you, that we should worship only God, not attribute any partner to Him, or take one another as lords apart from God. But if they turn away say, Testify that we are Muslims."3

Hadith - 3766
Sulaiman b. Buraida told on his father’s authority that when God’s Messenger appointed a commander over an army or a detachment he instructed him to fear God himself and consider the welfare of the Muslims who were with him. He then said, “Go forth in God’s name in God’s path and fight with those who disbelieve in God. Go forth and do not be unfaithful regarding booty, or treacherous, or mutilate anyone, or kill a child. When you meet the polytheists who are your enemy summon them to three things, and accept whichever of them they are willing to agree to, and refrain from them. Then* summon them to Islam, and if they agree accept it from them and refrain from them. Then summon them to leave their abodes and transfer to the abode of the Emigrants, and tell them that if they do so they will have the same rights and responsibilities as the Emigrants; but if they refuse to transfer from them tell them they will be like the desert Arabs who are Muslims, subject to God’s jurisdiction which applies to the believers, but will have no spoil or booty unless they strive with the Muslims. If they refuse demand the jizya from them, and if they agree accept it from them and refrain from them; but if they refuse seek God’s help and fight with them. When you invest a fortress and its people wish you to grant them the protection of God and His prophet, grant them neither but grant them your protection and that of your companions, for it is less serious to break your guarantee of protection and that of your companions than to break that of God and His Messenger. If you invest a fortress and its people offer to capitulate and have the matter referred to God’s jurisdiction, do not grant this, but let them capitulate and have the matter referred to your jurisdiction, for you do not know whether or not you will hit on God’s jurisdiction regarding them.” 
* What follows gives in detail the three things mentioned above.
Muslim transmitted it.
Hadith - 3767
‘Abdallah b. Abu Aufa told that at one of his battles in which God’s Messenger met the enemy he waited till the sun declined, then stood up among the people and said, “You people must not desire to meet the enemy, but must ask God for wellbeing, and when you meet them show endurance and know that paradise is under the shadows of the swords." He then said, “O God, who sendest down the Book, makest the clouds to travel and routest the confederates, rout them and give us victory over them.”

Hadith - 3768
Anas said: When the Prophet took us out on an expedition against a people he did not set out with us till the morning. He would look at them, and if he heard a call to prayer he refrained from them, but if he did not hear any he attacked them. We went out to Khaibar and reached them by night, but when the morning came and he heard no call to prayer he mounted. I mounted behind Abu Talha and my foot was touching God’s Prophet’s They came out to us with their large baskets and their spades, and when they saw the Prophet they said, “Muhammad, by God, Muhammad and the army," and went for refuge to the fortress. When God's Messenger saw them he said, “God is most great, God is most great. Khaibar has fallen.1 When we alight in the courtyard of a people it is an evil morning for those who have been warned."2

Peace be to those who follow the guidance. To proceed: We summon you to Islam, but if you refuse then pay the jizya in subjection feeling humbled (Cf. Al-Qur'an, 9:29).  If you refuse to do that, I have with me people who love being killed in God’s path as the Persians love wine. Peace be to those who follow the guidance.

Hadith - 3795
Ibn ‘Umar said: God’s Messenger sent us with a detachment and the people wheeled round in flight, so when we came to Medina we hid in it thinking that we had become corrupted.1 Then we went to God’s Messenger and told him we were those who had fled, but he replied, “No, you are the ones who return to fight after wheeling away, and I am your main body.”2 
1. Literally “had perished.” They thought that they had committed a serious sin by turning in flight.
2. The word fi’a is here used. The suggestion is that to withdraw to join one’s unit stationed in the rear is not flying from the enemy. Cf. Al-Qur’an; 8:16.
Tirmidhi transmitted it. Abu Dawud’s version has something similar. He said, “No, you are the ones who return to fight after wheeling away.” We then approached and kissed his hand, and he said, “I am the main body of the Muslims.”

Now we were in a weak condition and in a poor way with regard to mounts, and some of us were on foot. He went out in a hurry and coming to his camel made it go and it went off quickly with him. I hastened out and catching the camel’s nose-rein I made it kneel, then drew my sword and struck the man on his head. I then brought the camel leading it with his saddle and weapons on it, and when God's Messenger and the people met me he asked who had killed the man. On their replying that it was the son of al-Akwa‘, he said, “He gets all his spoil.” 
(Bukhari and Muslim.)

(Bukhari and Muslim.)
Hadith - 3801
Abu Huraira told that God's Messenger sent some horsemen to Najd and they brought a man of the B. Hanifa called Thumama b. Uthal who was the chief of the people of al-Yamama and bound him to one of the pillars of the mosque. God’s Messenger came out to him and said, “What are you expecting, Thumama?” He replied, “I expect good, Muhammad. If you kill me you will kill one whose blood will be avenged, if you show favour you will show it to one who is grateful, and if you want property and ask you will be given as much of it as you wish.” God’s Messenger left him till the next day, and asked him, “What are you expecting, Thumama?” He replied, “I am expecting what I said to you. If you show favour you will show it to one who is grateful, if you kill me you will kill one whose blood will be avenged, and if you want property and ask you will be given as much of it as you wish.” God's Messenger left him till the following day, and asked him, “What are you expecting, Thumama?” He replied, “I am expecting what I said to you. If you show favour you will show it to one who is grateful, if you kill me you will kill one whose blood will be avenged, and if you want property and ask you will be given as much of it as you wish.” God’s Messenger then said, “Set Thumama free.” He went off to some palm-trees near the mosque, and after bathing he entered the mosque and said, “I testify that there is no god but God, and I testify that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger. I swear by God, Muhammad, that there was no face on the face of the earth more hateful to me than yours, but your face has become the dearest of all to me. I swear by God that there was no religion more hateful to me than yours, but your religion has become the dearest of all to me. I swear by God that there was no town more hateful to me than yours, but your town has become the dearest of all to me. Your cavalry seized me when I was on my way to perform the umra, so what do you think I should do? God’s Messenger congratulated him and told him to perform the umra. When he came to Mecca someone asked him whether he had turned to folly* and he replied, “No, but I have accepted Islam along with God’s Messenger. I swear by God that not one grain of wheat will come to you from al-Yamama till God’s Messenger gives permission for it.” 
*Sabaut. The verb saba has as one of its meanings to turn to folly. It has been suggested that here it is used in the sense of the verb saba’a which means to change one’s religion. Final Hamza verbs very often do drop the Hamza, but they more normally follow the pattern of final ya’ verbs rather than final waw when they do so.
Muslim transmitted it, and Bukhari gave it more concisely.
Hadith - 3802
Jubair b. Mut'im reported the Prophet as saying about the prisoners taken at Badr, “If al-Mut‘im b. ‘Adi* had been alive and spoken to me about these filthy ones, I would have left them for him.” 
* He was head of the B. Naufal. He agreed to give Muhammad protection after his return from at-Ta'if where he had gone after Abu Talib’s death. Al-Mut‘im died before the battle of Badr. He did not become a Muslim.
Bukhari transmitted it.

Malik mentioned to him on the authority of Abu Talha that at the battle of Badr God’s prophet ordered twenty-four of the strong men of Quraish to be cast into one of the wells of Badr cased with stones which was corrupt and corrupting. When he prevailed over an enemy he stayed three nights on the field of battle; and when the third day came at Badr he ordered his riding-beast to be saddled. He then walked followed by his companions till he came to the mouth of the well, when he began to call them by their names and their fathers’ names, saying, “So and so son of so and so, so and so son of so and so, does it please you that you obeyed God and His Messenger? We have found what our Lord promised us to be true. Have you found what your Lord promised you to be true?” ‘Umar said, “Messenger of God, what you are addressing are only bodies without spirits.” The Prophet replied, “By Him in whose hand Muhammad's soul is, you cannot hear what I say better than they.” A version has, “You cannot hear better than they, but they cannot answer.” 
(Bukhari and Muslim.) Bukhari added that Qatada said God brought them to life and made them hear what he said by way of rebuke, humiliation, revenge, and to produce grief and repentance.
Hadith - 3805
Marwan and al-Miswar b. Makhrama told that when the deputation of Hawain came to God’s Messenger to accept Islam and asked him to return to them their property and their captives he stood up and said, “Choose one of the two, either the captives or the property.” When they replied that they chose their captives God’s Messenger stood up, and after extolling God in a fitting manner said, “To proceed: Your brethren have come repentant and I have considered that I should return their captives to them, so let those of you who are willing to release the captives act accordingly, but those who wish to hold on to what they have till I give them some of the first booty God gives us may do so.” The people told God’s Messenger that they were willing to release the captives, and he said, “I cannot distinguish between those of you who have granted that and those who have not, so return that your headmen may tell me about you.” They did so, and after their headmen had spoken to them they came back to God’s Messenger and told him they were agreeable and had given permission. 
Bukhari transmitted it.
Hadith - 3806
‘Imran b. Husain said: Thaqif were allies of the B. ‘Uqail, so when Thaqif took two of God’s Messenger’s companions prisoner, his companions took prisoner a man of the B. ‘Uqail, bound him and threw him out on the lava plain. God’s Messenger passed him and he called to him, “Muhammad, Muhammad, for what have I been taken?” He replied, “For the crime of your allies Thaqif.” He then left him and passed on, but when he cried, “Muhammad, Muhammad,” God’s Messenger took pity on him and returned and asked him about himself. When he told him he was a Muslim he said, “If you had said it when you were your own master you would have been completely successful.”* Then God’s Messenger ransomed him for the two men Thaqif had taken prisoner. 
*This means that not only would he go to paradise in the next life, but he would have been saved the experience of being taken a captive in this.
Muslim transmitted it.
Hadith - 3807
‘A’isha told that when the people of Mecca sent about ransoming their prisoners1 Zainab sent some property to ransom Abul ‘As, sending among it a necklace of hers which Khadija had had and had sent with her when she married Abul ‘As. When God’s Messenger saw it he felt great tenderness about it and said, “If you consider that you should free her prisoner for her and return to her what belongs to her it will be well.” To this they agreed. The Prophet had made an agreement with him that he should let Zainab come to him, so he sent Zaid b. Haritha and a man of the Helpers, telling them to wait in the valley of Yajij2 till Zainab came along and bring her back with them.
    1. After the battle of Badr.
    2. Near at-Tan'im.

Tirmidhi transmitted it, saying this is a gharib tradition.
Hadith - 3811
‘Atiya al-Qurazi said: I was among the captives of Quraiza who were brought before the Prophet.

Hadith - 3812
‘Ali told that some slaves came out to God’s Messenger, i.e. on the day of al-Hudaibiya, before the peace was ratified, and their masters wrote to him saying, “We swear by God, Muhammad, that they have not gone out to you through desire for your religion, but they have done so only to fly from servitude.” Some people assured him they had spoken the truth and advised him to send them back to them, but God’s Messenger became angry and said, “I do not think you people of Quraish will cease till God sends someone to you who will cut off your heads for this.” He refused to send them back, saving they were God’s freedmen.

But when a day came when Khalid ordered each of us to kill his prisoner, I said, “I swear by God that I will not kill my prisoner and that not one of my companions will kill his prisoner till we come to the Prophet.” When we mentioned the matter to him he raised his hands and said twice, “O God, I declare myself innocent in Thy sight of what Khalid has done.” 
*Here the verb saba'a is used.

Hadith - 3814
Umm Hani' daughter of Abu Talib said: I went to God’s Messenger in the year of the Conquest and found him bathing while his daughter Fatima was screening him with a garment. I gave a salutation and he asked who was there, then when I told him I was Umm Hani’ daughter of Abu Talib he said, “Welcome, Umm Hani’.” After he finished his bathing he got up and prayed eight rak'as wrapped in a garment, and when he was done I said, “Messenger of God, my mother’s son ‘Ali has asserted that he is going to kill a man to whom I have given protection, so and so the son of Hubaira.” He replied, “We have given protection to those to whom you have granted it, Umm Hani'.” She said that that was in the forenoon.

A man came on a horse, or a packhorse, saying, “God is most great, God is most great; let there be faithfulness and not treachery.”* And when they looked they found that he was 'Amr b. ‘Abasa. Mu'awiya questioned him about that and he replied that he had heard God’s Messenger say, "When one has a covenant with people he must not loosen or strengthen it till its term comes, or he brings it to an end in agreement with them.” He said that Mu'awiya then took the people back. 
*Mirqat, 4, 255 says that 'Amr b. ‘Abasa felt it was an act of treachery to make a treaty while in one’s own country and then approach the enemy’s country when the period of the treaty was near an end, so as to be able to make an immediate attack.

Hadith - 3823
Abu Qatada said: We went out with God’s Messenger in the year of Hunain, and when the armies met, the Muslims suffered a reverse. I saw one of the polytheists getting the better of one of the Muslims, so I struck him with my sword from behind on his shoulder-blade and cut his coat of mail. He came at me and closed with me, so that I felt death was near, but he was overtaken by death and let me go. I then caught up on ‘Umar b. al-Khattab and asked him what was the matter with the people, to which he replied that it was what God had commanded.1 Then they returned and the Prophet sat down and said, "If anyone kills a man and can prove it he will get his spoil.” I said, "Who will testify for me?” and then sat down. The Prophet said the same again and I said, "Who will testify for me?”2 and then sat down. Again the Prophet said the same and I stood up He asked, "What is the matter with you, Qatada?” and when I informed him a man said, "He has spoken the truth. I have his spoil, so make him agreeable to take something in exchange.” Abu Bakr said, “In that case I swear by God that he did not do so. One of God’s heroes3 does not fight for God and His Messenger and then give you his spoil.” The Prophet said he had spoken the truth and told the man to hand it over to me. He did so, and I bought a garden among the B. Salima. This was the first property I acquired in the Islamic period. 
    1. He wondered why the Muslims had fled from the enemy, and 'Umar replied that it was what God had decreed.
    2. There is doubt as to whether Abu Qatada spoke aloud the first two times, or inwardly. In the translation I have kept strictly to the wording in the Arabic.

Hurmuz told that Najda al-Haruri wrote to Ibn ‘Abbas asking whether a slave and a woman should be allotted a portion when they are present at the division of the spoil, and he told Yazid to write telling him they are not entitled to a portion, but may have a small amount given them. A version says that Ibn ‘Abbas wrote to him, “You have written asking me whether God’s Messenger took women on military expeditions and whether he allotted them a portion. He used to take them on military expeditions to tend the sick, and they would be given a little of the spoil, but so far as a portion is concerned he allotted them none.’’ 
Muslim transmitted it.
Hadith - 3826
Salama b. al-Akwa‘ said: God’s Messenger sent his riding-beasts with his servant Rabah and I went along with him. In the morning ‘Abd ar-Rahman al-Fazari raided God’s Messenger’s riding-beasts, so I went up on a mound and shouted three times facing Medina, “A morning raid!” I then went after the people shooting arrows at them and composing words in the rajaz metre saying, “I am the son of al-Akwa‘; today is the day  of the ignoble ones.”* I kept on shooting at them and killing their beasts so that they had to go on foot till there was no riding beast of God’s Messenger created by God which I had not gone ahead of. Then I followed them shooting at them till they threw away more than thirty cloaks and thirty lances to lighten themselves, and they threw nothing away without my putting stones on it to mark it for God’s Messenger and his companions to notice them. This went on till I saw God’s Messenger’s horsemen. Aba Qatada, God's Messenger's horseman, caught up on 'Abd ar-Rahman and killed him, and God's Messenger said, “Our best horseman today is Abu Qatada and our best footman Salama.” He then gave me two portions a horseman’s and a footman’s, and after giving me them both he took me up behind him on al-‘Adba’ on our way back to Medina. 
*The line, which is evidently an example of the dimeter of the rajaz metre, has something missing at the beginning. It goes:       انا ابن الاکوع والیوم الرضع             
The full form of the rajaz has the foot mustaf'ilun six times; the dimeter has it four times. In the line above two extra syallables are required at the beginning.

Abu Huraira told that God's Messenger stood up among them one day and mentioned dishonesty regarding spoil, treating it and everything connected with it as a serious matter. He then said, “Let me not find any of you coming on the day of resurrection with a camel rumbling on his neck and asking me to rescue him,* for I shall say that I can do nothing for him as I have given him full instruction. Let me not find any of you coming on the day of resurrection with a horse whinnying on his neck and asking me to rescue him, for I shall say that I can do nothing for him as I have given him full instruction. Let me not find any of you coming on the day of resurrection with a sheep bleating on his neck and asking me to rescue him, for I shall say that I can do nothing for him as I have given him full instruction. Let me not find any of you coming on the day of resurrection with a soul shouting on his neck asking me to rescue him, for I shall say that I can do nothing for him as I have given him full instruction. Let me not find any of you coming on the day of resurrection with patches flapping on his neck and asking me to rescue him, for I shall say that I can do nothing for him as I have given him full instruction. Let me not find any of you coming on the day of resurrection with gold and silver on his neck asking me to rescue him, for I shall say that I can do nothing for him as I have given him full instruction. 
*Here and in the following phrases the man seeks to be rescued from the thing about which he was dishonest, it being tied to his neck.
(Bukhari and Muslim, this being Muslim’s wording which is more complete.)
Hadith - 3834
He told that a man presented God’s Messenger with a slave called Mid'am, and while Mid'am was unsaddling a camel belonging to God’s Messenger he was struck by a random arrow which killed him. The people said, “Congratulations to him! He will go to paradise;” but God’s Messenger said, “Not at all. By Him in whose hand my soul is, the cloak he took on the day of Khaibar from the spoils which was not among the shares divided will blaze with fire upon him.” When the people heard that, a man brought a sandal-strap, or two sandal-straps, to the Prophet and said, “A sandal-strap of fire,” or, “Two sandal-straps of fire.” 
(Bukhari and Muslim.)
Hadith - 3835

I submitted to him a spell with which I used to treat people who were possessed and he ordered me to reject part of it and retain part.

Hadith - 3843
Mujammi' b. Jariya said: Khaibar was divided among those who had been at al-Hudaibiya, and God’s Messenger divided it into eighteen portions. The army was one thousand five hundred of which three hundred were cavalry, and he gave two shares to a horseman and one to a footman. Abu Dawud transmitted it, saying Ibn ‘Umar’s tradition1 is sounder, and it is the one which is followed. The error in the tradition of Mujammi’ was because he said three hundred horsemen when there were only two hundred.
Habib b. Maslama al-Fihri said he saw the Prophet give a quarter of the spoil on the outward journey and a third on the return journey.2 
1. I have available two editions of Abu Dawud’s Sunan (Cairo, 1280 and 1348 A .H.). Both give Ibn Mu'awiya in place of Ibn 'Umar. See Jihad, 144.
2. This tradition and the following one are explained as referring to a section of the army which comes in contact with the enemy. The greater amount granted them when this happens on the return journey is because there is more difficulty and danger in fighting after having gone through the campaign. The second tradition is more explicit by making it clear that the fifth was deducted.
Abu Dawud transmitted it.

Yazid who was a companion of God’s Messenger was in charge of us, and when I took it to him he divided it among the Muslims giving me the same as he gave the others. He then said that if he had not heard God’s Messenger say, “Booty is granted only after the fifth has been kept off,” he would have given it to me. 
Abu Dawud transmitted it.
Hadith - 3846
Abu Musa al-Ash'ari said: We arrived just at the moment when God’s Messenger had conquered Khaibar and he appointed us a portion (or he said he gave us some of it). He allotted nothing to anyone who was not present at the conquest of Khaibar, giving shares only to those who were present with him, except for those who were in our ship,* Ja'far and his companions to whom he appointed something along with them. 
*The party to which reference is made is that of people who had emigrated from Mecca to Abyssinia and were now returning.
Aba Dawud transmitted it.
Hadith - 3847
Yazid b. Khalid told that when one of God’s Messenger’s companions died at the battle of Khaibar they mentioned the matter to him and he replied, “Pray over your companion.” When the people looked perplexed at that he said, “Your companion was dishonest about booty in God’s path.” They searched his belongings and found some Jewish beads not worth two dirhams.

Hadith - 3848
‘Abdallah b. ‘Amr told that when God’s Messenger gained booty he ordered Bilal to make a public announcement, and when the people brought their booty he would take a fifth and divide it. One day a man brought a halter of hair after that and said, “Messenger of God, this is part of the booty we got.” He asked whether he had heard Bilal making announcement three times, and when he replied that he had, he asked what had prevented him from bringing it. He made some excuse, so he said, “You must bring it yourself on the day of resurrection, for I shall never accept it from you.”

A man got up with a ball of hair in his hand and said, “I took this to repair the cloth under a pack-saddle." The Prophet replied, “You can have what belongs to me and to the B. ‘Abd al-Muttalib," but the man said, "If it produces the result I now realise,* I have no desire for it," and he threw it away.

Hashim whose superiority we do not deny because of the position in which God has placed you in relation to them, but tell us about our brethren of the B. al-Muttalib to whom you have given something while omitting us though our relationship is the same as theirs."* God’s Messenger replied, "The B. Hashim and the B. al- Muttalib are one body like this," and he intertwined his fingers. 
* Cf. Chapter 8a
Shafi'i transmitted it, and there is something to the same effect in the version of Abu Dawud and Nasa'i. It says, "I and the B. al-Muttalib have not been separate in the pre-Islamic or in the Islamic period and they and we are one," intertwining his fingers.
Hadith - 3863
‘Abdar-Rahman b. ‘Auf said: When I stood in the rank at the battle of Badr I looked to my right and my left, and when I saw that I was between two young men of the Ansar I wished that I had been between men who were stronger than they. One of them pinched me and said, "Do you know Abu Jahl, uncle?" and I replied, "Yes, but what do you want with him, nephew?” He said, “I have been told that he reviles God's Messenger. By Him in whose hand my soul is, if I see him I shall not leave him till the one of us who is to die first dies.” I was astonished at that, and then the other pinched me and said the same to me. Before long I saw Abu Jahl going round among the people and I said, “Look, this is the man about whom you were asking.” They then hastened to him with their swords and struck him till they killed him, after which they went to God’s Messenger and informed him. He asked which of them had killed him and they both claimed to have done so. He then asked if they had wiped their swords, and when they replied that they had not he looked at the swords and said, “Both of you killed him.” God’s Messenger then decided that what was taken from him should go to Mu'adh b. ‘Amr b. al-Jamuh. The two men were Mu'adh b. ‘Amr b. al-Jamah and Mu'adh b. ‘Afra’.* 
*’Afra’ was his mother. His father was al-Harith.
(Bukhari and Muslim.)
Hadith - 3864
Anas reported God’s Messenger as saying at the battle of Badr, “Who will find out for us what has happened to Abu Jahl?” Ibn Mas'ud went and. found that the two sons of ‘Afra,’ had struck him till he was almost dead, so he seized him by his beard and said, “Are you Abu Jahl?” He replied, “Have you killed more than a man?” In a version he said, “I wish someone other than a tiller of the ground had killed me.” 
(Bukhari and Muslim.)
Hadith - 3865
Sa‘d b. Abu Waqqas said: While I was sitting God’s Messenger gave a company something but omitted the one who was most attractive to me. I therefore got up and said, ‘Why have you omitted so and so? I swear by God that I consider him to be a believer.” God’s Messenger replied, “No, a Muslim.” Sa'd mentioned that three times and he gave him the same reply, then said, “I give a man something although I like someone else better, from fear he may be thrown face downwards in hell.”

He then went on the expedition and approached the town at the time of the afternoon prayer or thereabouts. He then told the sun that both it and he were under command and prayed God to keep it back for them, so it was kept back till God gave him victory. He collected the spoils and it (meaning fire) came to devour them, but did not do so. Saying that there was dishonesty about spoil among them he told them that a man from every tribe must swear allegiance to him, and when a man’s hand stuck in his he said there was dishonesty about spoil among them. They brought him a head of gold like a cow’s head an when he had laid it down the fire came and devoured the spoil.* A version has, "Spoils were not allowable to anyone before us .Then God allowed spoils to us. He saw our weakness and incapacity and allowed them to us.” 
*This tradition combines elements of the story of Joshua commanding the sun to stand still (Joshua, 10:12) and the story of Achan’s sin (Joshua, 7:10 ff ).
(Bukhari and Muslim.)

Ibn ‘Abbas said he was told by ‘Umar that on the day of Khaibar some of the Prophet’s companions came and said, So and so is a martyr and so and so is a martyr,” but when they came to a man about whom they said, "So and so is a martyr” God’s Messenger declared, "By no means, I have seen him in hell in a mantle (or cloak) which he took dishonestly.” God's Messenger then said, "Go, Ibn al-Khattab, and announce among the people three times that only the believers will enter paradise.” He said he went out and announced three times, "Only the believers will enter paradise.”

Hadith - 3877
Al-Miswar b. Makhrama and Marwan b. al-Hakam told that the Prophet went out in the year of al-Hudaibiya with over ten hundreds of his companions, and when he came to Dhul Hulaifa he garlanded and marked the votive animals, entered the sacred state for an ‘umra, and then moved on. When he came to the mountain pass by which one descends to Mecca his riding-beasts knelt down and the people said, “Go on, go on! Al-Qaswa’ has become jaded.” But the Prophet said, “Al- Qaswa’ has not become jaded, for that is not a characteristic of hers, but He who restrained the elephant1 has restrained her.” Then he said, “By Him in whose hand my soul is, they will not ask me any good thing by which they honour what God has made sacred without my giving them it.” He then urged her and she leaped up and he turned aside from the road to Mecca and stopped at the farthest point of al-Hudaibiya at a pool with little water which the people collected in small quantities and soon exhausted. Complaint of thirst was made to God’s Messenger, so he drew an arrow from his quiver and ordered them to put it in it, whereupon to their astonishment it kept gushing out to them with water till they left it. Meanwhile Budail b. Warqa’ al Khuza’i came with some members of Khuza’a and ‘Urwa b. Mas'ud joined him. He went on with the tradition2 to the point where he said that when Suhail b. ‘Amr came the Prophet said, “Write: This is what Muhammad God's Messenger has decided.” Suhail protested, “I swear by God that if we knew you were God’s Messenger we would not turn you away from the House or fight with you; but write: Muhammad b. ‘Abdallah.” The Prophet replied, “I swear by God that I am God’s Messenger even if you disbelieve me; write Muhammad b. ‘Abdallah.” Suhail said, “And that a man will not come to you from us, even if he follows your religion, without your sending him back to us." Then when he finished drawing up the document God’s Messenger said to his companions, "Get up and sacrifice, and then shave.” Thereafter some believing women came and God most high sent down, "O you who believe, when believing women come to you as emigrants…”3 God most high forbade them to send them back, but ordered them to restore the dower. When the Prophet returned to Medina Abu Basir, a man of Quraish who was a Muslim, came to him and they sent two men to look for him, so he handed him over to the two men. They took him away, and when they reached Dhul Hulaifa and alighted to eat some dates which they had Abu Basir said to one of the men, "I swear by God, so and so, that I think this sword of yours is a fine one; let me look at it.” He let him have it and he struck him till he died, whereupon the other fled from him and when he reached Medina went running into the mosque. The Prophet said, “This man has seen something frightful.” He said, “I swear by God that my companion has been killed, and I am as good as dead.”4 Abu Basir arrived and the Prophet said, "Woe to his mother, stirrer up of war! Would that he had some kinsfolk!”5 When he heard that he knew that he would send him back to them, so he went out and came to the seashore. Abu Jandal b. Suhail escaped and joined Abu Basir, and it became the practice that every man of Quraish who went out having accepted Islam joined Abu Basir, till a band of them collected. Whenever they heard of a caravan which belonged to Quraish going out to Syria they intercepted it, killed the men and seized their goods; so Quraish sent a message to the Prophet adjuring him by God and the ties of relationship to send instructions to them to stop, and agreeing that anyone who came to him would be safe. So the Prophet sent them instructions. 
    1. Cf. Al-Qur'an; 105.

    3. Al-Qur'an; 60:10.
    4. Literally “and I am killed."
    5. Literally “would that he had someone!” It probably means that the Prophet wished Abu Basir had had some kinsfolk to whom he could go, and so save him the necessity of returning him to Mecca.
    6. Bukhari's tradition is very long. In the version given here it is much reduced, the purpose evidently being to give the essential parts of it without including every detail.

Al-Bara’ b. ‘Azib said: God’s Messenger went to perform an ‘umra in Dhul Qa'da, but the people of Mecca refused to let him enter Mecca till he had made an agreement with them to enter (i.e. in the following year) and stay three days. Then when on writing the document they wrote, "This is what Muhammad God’s Messenger has agreed,” the Meccans said, “We do not acknowledge it, for if we knew you were God’s Messenger we would not prevent you; but you are Muhammad b. ‘Abdallah.” He replied, "I am' both God's Messenger and Muhammad b. ‘Abdallah.” He then told ‘Ali b. Abu Talib to obliterate "Messenger of God”, and when he protested, "No, I swear by God, I will never obliterate it,” God's Messenger took it, and although he did not write well, he wrote, ‘‘this is what Muhammad b. ‘Abdallah has agreed. The only weapon with which he will enter Mecca will be a sword in the scabbard; if any of its people wishes to follow him he will not take him out; and if any of his companions wishes to stay in it he will not prevent him.” Then when he entered and the appointed period elapsed they went to 'Ali and told him to tell his friend to leave them for the appointed period had elapsed. So the Prophet went out.

Ibn 'Umar told that 'Umar stood up to make a speech and said, “God’s Messenger employed the Jews of Khaibar to work their property and told them he would confirm them in it as long as God did; and I have now seen good to deport them.” When ‘Umar decided on that one of the B. Abul Huqaiq came to him and said, “Commander of the Faithful, are you expelling us when Muhammad has confirmed us in our property and employed us to work it?” 'Umar replied, “Do you think I have forgotten what God’s Messenger said when he asked how you would feel when you were expelled from Khaibar, your camel running along with you night after night?” He said, “This was a little joke on the part of Abul Qasim,” to which ‘Umar retorted, “You lie, enemy of God.” He then deported them, giving them the value of the fruits they possessed in money, camels and goods such as saddles, ropes, etc.

Hadith - 3889
Ibn ‘Umar told that ‘Umar b. al-Khattab deported the Jews and the Christians from the land of the Hijaz and when God’s Messenger got supremacy over the people of Khaibar he intended to expel the Jews from it, for when the land was conquered it belonged to God, His Messenger and the Muslims. But the Jews asked God’s Messenger to leave them on condition that they should do all the cultivation and have half the produce, and he replied, “We shall confirm you on that condition as long as we wish.” So they were confirmed till ‘Umar deported them during his period of rule to Taima and Jericho. 
(Bukhari and Muslim.)
Hadith - 3890
Malik b. Aus b. al-Hadathan reported "Umar b. al-Khattab as saying that God appointed His Messenger a special portion in this fai’* which He gave to no other. He then recited, “What God has bestowed on His Messenger from them . . . omnipotent" (Al-Qur’an; 59:6). This was purely for God’s Messenger who used to give his family their annual contribution from this property, then take what remained and deal with it as he did with God’s property.
 *Fai’ is the term used for tribute from territory the Muslims have conquered.
(Bukhari and Muslim.)
Hadith - 3891
‘Umar said that the properties of the B. an-Nadir were part of what God bestowed on His Messenger from what the Muslims had not ridden on horses or camels to get; so they belonged specially to God’s Messenger who gave his family their annual contribution, then applied what remained for weapons and horses as equipment in God’s path. 
(Bukhari and Muslim.)
Hadith - 3892
‘Auf b. Malik said: When the fai’ came to God's Messenger he divided it that day, giving two portions to a married man and one to a bachelor. I was summoned and he gave me two portions, for I had a family; then ‘Ammar b. Yasir was summoned after me and given one. 
Abu Dawud transmitted it.
Hadith - 3893
Ibn ‘Umar told that he saw the first thing God’s Messenger did immediately anything came to him was to give something to those who had been set free. 
Abu Dawud transmitted it.
Hadith - 3894
‘A’isha said the Prophet was brought a pouch containing beads and divided it among freewomen and slave women. She said her father used to divide things between freemen and slaves. 
Abu Dawud transmitted it.
Hadith - 3895
Malik b. Aus b. al-Hadathan told that one day ‘Umar b. al-Khattab mentioned the fai’ saying: I have no more right to this fai’ than you, and none of us has more right to it than another, except that we occupy our positions fixed by the Book of God who is great and glorious and the division made by His Messenger, people being arranged according to their precedence in accepting Islam, the hardships they have endured, their having children, and their need. 
Abu Dawud transmitted it.
Hadith - 3896
He told that ‘Umar b. al-Khattab recited, “Alms are for the poor and needy…Knowing, Wise," (Al-Qur’an; 9:60) and said that this verse applies to such. He then recited, “Know that a fifth of whatever booty you acquire goes to God and the Messenger . . . the traveller," (Al-Qur’an; 8:41) and said that this verse applies to such. He then recited, “What God has bestowed on His Messenger from the people of the towns ... to the poor" (Al-Qur’an; 59:7 f. The last word mentioned is the first word of verse 8. It may mean that he recited the whole of verse 8). He then recited, “And those who came after them," (Al-Qur’an; 59:10) saying that this includes all the Muslims, and adding that if he lived the herdsman in the sarw* of Himyar would certainly get his share which he had not earned by the sweat of his brow.	
* The word means a hill slope above a valley, not right upon the mountain. When associated with Himyar it is said to mean their settlement, cf. Yaqut, Mu'jam, iii, 82. The Himyarites were a famous South Arabian people.
It is transmitted in Sharh as-sunna.
Hadith - 3897
He told that one of the arguments put forward by 'Umar was that he said God’s Messenger received three things exclusively to himself: the B. an-Nadir, Khaibar and Fadak.1 The B. an-Nadir property was kept wholly for his own purposes,2 Fadak for travellers, and Khaibar was divided by God’s Messenger into three sections, two for the Muslims and one as a contribution for his family. If anything remained after making the contribution to his family, he divided it among the poor Emigrants. 
    1. Fadak was near Khaibar. It capitulated without fighting.
    2. This would include, besides personal needs, the cost of entertaining guests, providing weapons and animals, etc.
Abu Dawud transmitted it.
Hadith - 3898
Al-Mughira b. Shu’ba told that when ‘Umar b. ‘Abd al-‘Aziz was made Caliph he gathered the family, of Marwan and said: Fadak belonged, to God’s Messenger, and he made contributions from it, showing repeated kindness to the poor members of the B. Hashim from it and supplying: from it the cost of marriages for those of them who were unmarried. Fatima asked him to give it to her, but he refused. That is how matters stood during the lifetime of God’s Messenger till he went his way (i.e. he died). When Abu Bakr was made ruler he administered it as God's Messenger had done in his lifetime till he went his way. Then when ‘Umar b. al- Khattab was made ruler he administered it as they had done till he went his way. Then Marwan took it for himself and it afterwards came to ‘Umar b. ‘Abd al-‘Aziz, but I consider that I have no right to something which God’s Messenger refused to Fatima, and I call you to witness that I have restored it to its former condition; meaning in the time of God’s Messenger, Abu Bakr and ‘Umar. 
Abu Dawud transmitted it.
