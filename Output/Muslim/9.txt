Anas bin Malik reported that a person entered the mosque through the door situated on the side of Daral-Qada' during Friday (prayer) and the messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was delivering the sermon while standing. He came and stood in front of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: Messenger of Allah, the camels died and the passages were blocked; so supplicate Allah to send down rain upon us. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) raised his hands and then said: (O Allah, send down rain upon us; O Allah, send down rain upon us; O Allah, send down rain upon us.) Anas said: By Allah, we did not see any cloud or any patch of it, and there was neither any house or building standing between us and the (hillock) Sal'a. There appeared a cloud in the shape of a shield from behind it, and as it (came high) in the sky it spread and then there was a downpour of rain. By Allah, we did not see the sun throughout the week. Then (that very man) came on the coming Friday through the same door when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was standing and delivering the sermon. He stood in front of him and said: Messenger of Allah, our animals died and the passages blocked. Supplicate Allah to stop the rain for us. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) again raised his hands and said: O Allah, let it (rain) fall in our suburbs and not on us, O Allah (send it down) on the hillocks and small mountains and the river-beds and at places where trees grow. The rain stopped, and as we stepped out we were walking in sunshine. He (the narrator) said to Sharik: I asked Anas bin Malik if he was the same man. He said: I do not know.

The rest of the hadith is the same (and the words are) that he (the Holy Prophet) said: O Allah, send down rain in our suburbs but not on us.
