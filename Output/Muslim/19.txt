Hadith - 1
Sahl bin Sa'd al-Sa'idi reported, that 'Uwaimir al-'Ajlani came to 'Asim bin 'Adi al-Ansari and said to him, "Tell me about a person who finds a man with his wife; should he kill him, and be killed in retaliation; or how should he act? 'Asim, ask for me (religious verdict about it) from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)."
So 'Asim asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and he did not like this question, and he disapproved of it so much that 'Asim felt aggrieved at what he had heard from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).
When 'Asim came back to his family, 'Uwaimir came to him and said: "'Asim, what did Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) say to you?"
'Asim said to 'Uwaimir: "You did not bring something good. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did not like this religious verdict that I sought from him."
'Uwaimir said: "By Allah, I will not rest until I have asked him about it."
'Uwaimir proceeded until he came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as he was sitting amidst people, and said: "Messenger of Allah, tell me about a person who found a man with his wife. Should he kill him, and then you would kill him, or how should he act?"
Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: "(Verses) have been revealed concerning you and your wife; so go and bring her."
Sahl said that they both invoked curses (and further said): I was along with people in the company of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).
And when they had finished, Uwaimir said: "Allah's Messenger, I shall have told a lie against her if I keep her (now)." So he divorced her with three pronouncements before Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had commanded him.
Ibn Shihab said: Subsequently that was the practice of invokers of curses (al-Mutala'inain).
Hadith - 2
Sahl bin Sa'd reported: 'Uwaimir al-Ansari (Allah be pleased with him) from Banu'l-'Ajlan came to 'Asim bin 'Adi (Allah be pleased with him) - the remaining part of the hadith is the same, and it was also recorded in it: "And subsequently the separation became the practice of al-Mutala'inain."
And this addition was also made: "She was pregnant and her son was ascribed to her, and it became customary that such (a son) would inherit her, and she would inherit him in the share prescribed by Allah for her."
Hadith - 3
Ibn Shihab narrated about the invokers of curses and the practice of (li'an) based on the authority of Sahl bin Sa'd, of the tribe of Sa'ida, that a person from the Ansar came to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and said: "Allah's Messenger, tell me about the person who found a man with his wife."
The remaining part of the hadith is the same (but) with this addition: They invoked curses in the mosque and I was present there.
And he narrated in the hadith: He divorced her with three pronouncements before Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) commanded him (to get separation). He separated from her in the presence of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), whereupon he said: "There is a separation between the invokers of curses."
Hadith - 4
Sa'id bin Jubair reported: I was asked about the invokers of curses during the reign of Mus'ab (bin Zubair) whether they could separate (themselves by this process).
He said: I did not understand what to say. So I went to the house of Ibn 'Umar (Allah be pleased with them) in Mecca.
I said to his servant: "Seek permission for me." He said that he (Ibn 'Umar) had been taking rest.
He (Ibn 'Umar) heard my voice and said: "Are you Ibn Jubair?" I said: "Yes." He said: "Come in. By Allah, it must be some (great) need which has brought you here at this Hour."
So I got in and found him lying on a blanket reclining against a pillow stuffed with fibres of date-palm. I said: "O Abu 'Abd al-Rahman, should there be separation between the invokers of curses?"
He said: 'Hallowed be Allah, yes, The first one who asked about it was so and so.
He said: "Messenger of Allah, tell me, if one of us finds his wife committing adultery, what should he do? If he talks, that is something great, and if he keeps quiet, that is also (something great) (which he cannot afford to do)."
Allah's Prophet (ﷺ) kept quiet (or some time). After some time he (that very person) came to him (Allah's Messenger) and said: "I have been involved in that very case about which I had asked you."
Allah the Exalted and Majestic then revealed (these) verses of Surah Nur: {Those who accuse their wives} (verse 6), and he (the Holy Prophet) recited them to him and admonished him, and exhorted him and informed him that the torment of the world is less painful than the torment of the Hereafter.
He said: "No, by Him Who sent you with Truth, I did not tell a lie against her."
He (the Holy Prophet) then called her (the wife of that person who had accused her) and admonished her, and exhorted her, and informed her that the torment of this world is less painful than the torment of the Hereafter.
She said: "No, by Him Who sent thee with Truth, he is a liar."
(It was) the man who started the swearing of oath, and he swore in the name of Allah four times that he was among the truthful, and at the fifth turn he said: "Let there be curse of Allah upon him if he were among the liars."
Then the woman was called and she swore four times in the name of Allah that he (her husband) was among the liars, and at the fifth time (she said): "Let there be curse upon her if he were among the truthful."
He (the Holy Prophet) then effected separation between the two.'

He said: "Messenger of Allah, what about my wealth (dower that I paid her at the time of marriage)?"
He said: "You have no claim to wealth. If you tell the truth, it (dower) is the recompense for your having had the right to intercourse with her, and if you tell a lie against her, it is still more remote from you than she is."

By Allah, I will definitely ask about him from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)."
On the following day, he came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and asked him thus: "If a man were to find with his wife a man, and if he were to talk about it, you would lash him; and if he killed, you would kill him, and if he were to keep quiet, he would consume anger," whereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: "Allah, solve (this problem)," and he began to supplicate (before Him), and then the verses pertaining to li'an were revealed: {Those who accuse their wives and have no witnesses except themselves} (Surah 24: Ayah 6).
The person was then put to test according to these verses in the presence of the people.
There came he and his wife in the presence of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and they invoked curses (in order to testify their claim).
The man swore four times in the name of Allah that he was one of the truthful, and then invoked curse for the fifth time saying: "Let there be curse of Allah upon him if he were among the liars."
Then she began to invoke curse. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to her: "Just wait (and curse after considering over it)," but she refused and invoked the curse, and when she turned away, he (Allah's Apostle) said: "It seems that this woman shall give birth to a curly-haired black child," and so she did gave birth to a curly-haired black child.

And he was the first person who invoked curse (li'an) in Islam. He, in fact, invoked curse upon her.
Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: "See to her, if she gives birth to a white-complexioned child having dark hair and bright eyes; he must be the son of Hilal bin Umayya; and if she gives birth to a child with dark eyelids, curly hair and lean shanks, he must be the offspring of Sharik bin Sahma."

When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) heard of that, he said: "Are you surprised at Sa'd's jealousy of his honour? By Allah, I am more jealous of my honour than he, and Allah is more jealous than I.
Because of His jealousy, Allah has prohibited abomination, both open and secret. And no person is more jealous of his honour than Allah, and no persons is more fond of accepting an excuse than Allah, on account of which He has sent messengers, announcers of glad tidings and warners; and no one is more fond of praise than Allah, on account of which Allah has promised Paradise."
