When our servant would come, we would give you your silver (dirhams due to you)."
Thereupon 'Umar bin al-Khattab (Allah be pleased with him) said: 'Not at all. By Allah, either give him his silver (coins), or return his gold to him, for Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: "Exchange of silver for gold (has an element of) interest in it, except when (it is exchanged) on the spot; and wheat for wheat is an interest, unless both are handed over on the spot; barley for barley is interest, unless both are handed over on the spot; dates for dates is interest, unless both are handed over on the spot."

Abi Qilabah reported: I was in Syria (having) a circle (of friends) in which was Muslim bin Yasir. There came Abu'l-Ash'ath.
He (the narrator) said that they (the friends) called him: "Abu'l-Ash'ath, Abu'l-Ash'ath," and he sat down.
I said to him: Narrate to our brother the hadith of Ubada bin Samit.
He said: Yes. We went out on an expedition, Mu'awiya being the leader of the people, and we gained a lot of spoils of war. And there was one silver utensil in what we took as spoils.
Mu'awiya ordered a person to sell it for payment to the people (soldiers). The people made haste in getting that.
The news of (this state of affairs) reached 'Ubada bin Samit, and he stood up and said: "I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) forbidding the sale of gold by gold, and silver by silver, and wheat by wheat, and barley by barley, and dates by dates, and salt by salt, except like for like and equal for equal.
So he who made an addition or who accepted an addition (committed the sin of taking) interest."
So the people returned what they had got. This reached Mu'awiya, and he stood up to deliver an address.
He said: "What is the matter with people that they narrate from the Messenger (ﷺ) such tradition which we did not hear, though we saw him (the Holy Prophet) and lived in his company?"
Thereupon, Ubada bin Samit stood up and repeated that narration, and then said: "We will definitely narrate what we heard from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) though it may be unpleasant to Mu'awiya (or he said: Even if it is against his will). I do not mind if I do not remain in his troop in the dark night."
Hammad said this or something like this.

I went to al-Bara' bin 'Azib and asked him, and he said: Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) came to Medina and we made such transaction, whereupon he said: "In case the payment is made on the spot, there is no harm in it, and in case (it is sold) on loan, it is usury. You better go to Zaid bin Arqam, for he is a greater trader than I;" so I went to him and asked him, and he said like it.

When he came to Ma'mar he informed him about that, whereupon Ma'mar said to him: 'Why did you do that? Go back and return that, and do not accept but weight for weight, for I used to hear from Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) as saying: "Wheat for wheat and like for like."'
He (one of the narrators) said: Our food in those days consisted of barley. It was said to him (Ma'mar) that (wheat) is not like that (barley). He replied: "I am afraid these may not be similar."

He came with a fine quality of dates, whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to him: "Are all the dates of Khaibar like this?"
He said: "Allah's Messenger, it is not so. We buy one sa' of (fine quality of dates) for two sa's out of total output (including even the inferior quality of dates)," whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: "Don't do that, but like for like, or sell this (the inferior quality and receive the price) and then buy with the price of that, and that would make up the measure."
Hadith - 121

Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: "Don't do that, rather, sell the inferior quality of dates for dirhams (money), and then buy the superior quality with the help of dirhams."
Hadith - 122
Abd Sa'id reported: Bilal (Allah be pleased with him) came with fine quality of dates. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to him: "From where (you have brought them)?"
Bilal said: "We had inferior quality of dates, and I exchanged two sa's (of inferior quality) with one sa (of fine quality) as food for Allah's Apostle (ﷺ)," whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: "Woe! It is in fact usury; therefore, don't do that. But when you intend to buy dates (of superior quality), sell (the inferior quality) in a separate bargain, and then buy (the superior quality)."
And in the hadith transmitted by Ibn Sahl, there is no mention of "whereupon."
Hadith - 123
Abu Sa'id (Allah be pleased with him) reported: Dates were brought to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and he said: "These dates are not like our dates," whereupon a man said: "We sold two sa's of our dates (in order to get) one sa' of these (fine dates)," whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: "That is interest; so return (these dates of fine quality), and get your (inferior dates); then sell our dates (for money) and buy for us (with the help of money) such (fine dates)."
Hadith - 124
Abu Sa'id (Allah be pleased with him) reported: We were given to eat, during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), dates of different qualities mixed together, and we used to sell two sa's of these for one sa, (of fine quality of dates).
This reached Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), whereupon he said: "There should be no exchange of two sa's of (inferior) dates for one sa (of fine dates) and two sa's of (inferior) wheat for one sa' of (fine) wheat, and one dirham for two dirhams."
Hadith - 125
Abu Nadra reported: I asked Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) about the conversion (of gold and silver for silver and gold). We said: Is it hand to hand exchange? I said: Yes.
Whereupon he said: There is no harm in it. I informed Abu Sa'id about it, telling him that I had asked Ibn 'Abbas about it, and he said: "Is it hand to hand exchange?" I said: "Yes," whereupon he said: "There is no harm in it."
He (the narrator) said, or he said like it: We will soon write to him, and he will not give you this fatwa (religious verdict).
He said: By Allah, someone of the boy-servants of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) brought dates, but he refused to accept them (on the plea) that those did not seem to be of the dates of our land.
He said: Something had happened to the dates of our land, or our dates. So I got these dates (in exchange by giving) excess (of the dates of our land), whereupon he said: "You made an addition for getting the fine dates (in exchange) which tantamounts to interest; don't do that (in future). Whenever you find some doubt (as regards the deteriorating quality of) your dates, sell them, and then buy the dates that you like."
Hadith - 126
Abu Nadra reported: I asked Ibn Umar and Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) about the conversion of gold with gold, but they did not find any harm in that.
I was sitting in the company of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri (Allah be pleased with him) and asked him about this exchange, and he said: "Whatever is addition is an interest." I refused to accept it on account of their statement (statement of Ibn 'Abbas and Ibn 'Umar).
He said: I am not narrating to you except what I heard from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). There came to him the owner of a date-palm with one sa' of fine dates, and the dates of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) were of that colour. Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said to him: "Where did you get these dates?"
He said: "I went with two sa's of (inferior dates) and bought one sa' of (these fine dates), for that is the prevailing price (of inferior dates) in the market, and that is the price (of the fine quality of dates in the market)," whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: "Woe be upon you! You have dealt in interest when you decide to do it (i.e. exchange superior quality of dates for inferior quality); so you should sell your dates for another commodity (or currency) and then with the help of that commodity buy the dates you like."
Abu Sa'id said: When dates are exchanged for dates (with different qualities) there is the possibility (of the element of) interest (creeping into that) or when gold is exchanged for gold having different qualities.
I subsequently came to Ibn 'Umar, and he forbade me (to do it), but I did not come to Ibn 'Abbas; (Allah be pleased with them).
He (the narrator) said: Abu as-Sahba' narrated to me: "He asked Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) in Mecca, and he too disapproved of it."
Hadith - 127
Abu Salih reported: I heard Abu Sa'id al-Khudri (Allah be pleased with him) said: Dinar (gold) for gold and dirham for dirham can be (exchanged) with equal for equal; but he who gives more or demands more, in fact, deals in interest.
I said to him: Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) says otherwise, whereupon he said: I met Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) and said: "Do you see what you say; have you heard it from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), or found it in the Book of Allah, the Glorious and Majestic?"
He said: 'I did not hear it from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and I did not find it in the Book of Allah (Glorious and Majestic), but Usama bin Zaid narrated it to me that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said: "There can be an element of interest in credit."'
Hadith - 128

Hadith - 130
Ata' bin Abu Rabah reported: Abu Sa'id al-Khudri (Allah be pleased with them) met Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) and said to him: What do you say in regard to the conversion (of commodities or money) did you hear it from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), or is it something which you found in Allah's Book, Majestic and Glorious?
Thereupon Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) said: I don't say that. So far as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) is concerned, you know him better, and so far as the Book of Allah to concerned, I do not know it (more than you do), but 'Usama bin Zaid (Allah be pleased with him) narrated to me Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as having said this: "Beware, there can be an element of interest in credit."
Hadith - 131
Abdullah (bin Mas'ud) (Allah be pleased with him) said that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) cursed the one who accepted interest and the one who paid it.
I asked about the one who recorded it, and two witnesses to it. He (the narrator) said: We narrate what we have heard.
Hadith - 132

Hadith - 133
Nu'man bin Bashir (Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as having said this (and Nu'man pointed towards his ears with his fingers): "What is lawful is evident and what is unlawful is evident, and in between them are the things doubtful which many people do not know.
So he who guards against doubtful things, keeps his religion and honour blameless, and he who indulges in doubtful things, indulges in fact in unlawful things, just as a shepherd who pastures his animals round a preserve will soon pasture them in it.
Beware, every king has a preserve, and the things God has declared unlawful are His preserves.
Beware, in the body there is a piece of flesh; if it is sound, the whole body is sound, and if it is corrupt the whole body is corrupt, and hearken, it is the heart."

Hadith - 137
Jabir bin 'Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported that he was travelling on his camel which had grown jaded, and he decided to let it off. When Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) met him and prayed for him and struck it, so it trotted as it had never trotted before.
He said: "Sell it to me for an 'uqiyya." I said: "No." He again said: "Sell it to me." So I sold it to him for an 'uqiyya, but made the stipulation that I should be allowed to ride back to my family.
Then, when I came to (my place) I took the camel to him, and he paid me its price in ready money.
I then went back, and he sent (someone) behind me (and as I came) he said: "Do you see that I asked you to reduce price for buying your camel. Take your camel and your coins; these are yours."

He (the Holy Prophet) said to me: "What is the matter with your camel?" I said: "It is sick." He (the Holy Prophet) stepped behind and drove it and prayed for it, and then it always moved ahead of other camels.
He (then) said: "How do you find your camel?" I said: "It is, by the grace of your prayer, all right."
He said: "Would you sell this (camel) to me?" I felt shy (to say him, "No") as we had no other camel for carrying water, but (later on) I said: "Yes," and to I sold it to him on the condition that (I would be permitted) to ride it until I reached Madina.
I said to him: "Allah's Messenger, I am newly married," so I asked his permission (to go ahead of the caravan). He permitted me, and I reached Medina well in advance of other people, until I reached my destination.
There my maternal uncle met me and asked me about the camel, and I told him what I had done with regard to it. He reproved me in this connection.
He (Jabir) said: When I asked his permission (to go ahead of the caravan) Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) inquired of me whether I had married a virgin or a non-virgin.
I said to him: "I have married a non-virgin." He said: "Why did you not marry a virgin who would have played with you and you would have played with her?"
I said to him: "Allah's Messenger, my father died (or he fell as a martyr), and I have small sisters to (look after), so I did not like the idea that I should marry a woman who is like them, and thus be not able to teach them manners and look after them properly. So I have married a non-virgin so that she should be able to look after them and teach them manners."
When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to Medina, I went to him in the morning with the camel. He paid me its price and returned that (the camel) to me.
Hadith - 140
Jabir reported: "We went from Mecca to Medina with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) when my camel fell ill," and the rest of the hadith is the same.
(But it is also narrated in it: ) He (the Holy Prophet) said to me: "Sell your camel to me." I said: "No, but it is yours."
He said: "No, (it can't be), but sell it to me." I said: "No, but, Allah's Messenger, it is yours."
He said: "No, it can't be, but sell it to me." I said: "Then give me an 'uqiyya of gold, for I owe that to a person and then it would be yours." He (the Holy Prophet) said: "I take it (for an 'uqiya of gold) and you reach Medina on it."
As I reached Medina, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to Bilal: "Give him an 'uqiya of gold and make some extra payment too." He (Jabir) said: "He gave me an 'uqiya of gold and made an addition of a qirat."
He (Jabir) said: The addition made by Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was with me (as a sacred trust for blessing) and lay with me in a pocket until the people of Syria took it on the Day of Harra.

Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) met me and said: "Sell it to me," and I sold it for five 'uqiyas. I said: "On the condition that I may use it as a ride (for going back) to Medina." He (the Holy Prophet) said: "Well, you may use it as a ride up till Medina."
When I came to Medina, I handed over that to him, and he made an addition of an uqiya (to that amount which had been agreed upon) and then presented that (camel) to me.
